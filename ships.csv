Aberdeen Press & Journal, 01/02/1911:
Launch of a Trawler - Messrs Irvin and Sons' new vessel: Messrs Hall, Russell and Company, Ltd., launched from their yard at Footdee yesterday a steam trawler, built to the order of Messrs Richard Irvin and Sons, Ltd., Aberdeen. The vessel, which will take the highest class in Lloyd's register, is of the following dimensions: Length (b.p.), 115ft; breadth, 22ft; and depth, 12ft 9in. The steel boiler and triple expansion engine will be supplied and fitted by the builders.
The launching of the vessel was witnessed by large crowds of spectators. Mrs A. Spence Macdonald performed the ceremony, and, as the vessel gracefully left the ways she was named ""A Spence Macdonald.""
A cake and wine banquet was afterwards held, among those present being Mr A. Hall Wilson, who presided; Mr James Y. Hunter, Mr J. H. Anderson, and Mr Francis Coutts, and Mr A. Spence Macdonald, one of the directors; Mrs Spence Macdonald, and Mr James Tulloch.
The Chairman wished success to the trawler which had just been launched, and prosperity to her owners, Messrs Irvin and Sons. He thought the manner in which the trawler went down the ways when Mrs Spence Macdonald broke the bottle was a happy augury for the success of the vessel. He hoped the vessel would be a successful as the other which the company had built. (Applause) In the absence of Mr Irvin, through indisposition, he coupled the toast with the named of Mr A. Spence Macdonald.
Mr A. Spence Macdonald thanked the company for the way in which the toast had been received. This was the sixth of the series of these ships which Hall, Russell had launched. The other five had done very well, and it was to be hoped that this addition would be equally successful. (Applause)
Mr James Tulloch proposed the health of Mrs Spence Macdonald, who so gracefully named the vessel. It pleased him very much that the launch had been so successful, and he was sure they would drink very cordially to the health of the lady. (Applause)
Mr A. Spence Macdonald replied on behalf of his wife.
My Tulloch also proposed prosperity to the firm which had launched the vessel, and in doing so he made special reference to the chairman and Mr Hunter. These two gentlemen were discharging their duties as builders in a most thorough manner, keeping up the name and reputation of the firm for the first class vessels they turned out. They were pleased to know that the company had received an order from the Government to build one of their ships, and he hoped that was just one of the orders that would come from the Government. (Applause)
Mr Hall Wilson, in replying, said he was sure it would always be their endeavour to turn out such work as would give every satisfaction to their customer, and which would be a credit, not only to themselves but to the port of Aberdeen. (Applause)
""Bon-Accord"" was given from the chair, and was heartily pledged."

Screw steamer ABERDEEN, of Aberdeen, Capt. Baxter, has arrived Shields from Carthagena. Captain reports that off Lisbon, about 5a.m., 7 April, weather foggy and going dead slow, he heard a fog horn on port bow and almost immediately cries for assistance.  Steamer was at once stopped, when it was found ABERDEEN had struck a fishing boat and cut her down to water's edge.  Measures were at once taken to save the crew, one man got hold of a rope that was thrown and got aboard the steamer. Rest of crew managed to get their own boat out before fishing boat sank. They were taken aboard the steamer and afterwards transferred to another fishing vessel.

Dock designed to lift a vessel of 600 tons displacement drawing 15 feet within a time of 30 minutes or to lift a vessel of 700 tons displacement and 16 feet draught in a corresponding longer time.  Freeboard at centre at ends 6"".

The Pontoon Dock was situated at the top of Point Law, Albert Quay along with Dock No. 2.  It was used mainly to lift the trawlers out of the water to get the bottoms cleaned and repainted and other underwater tasks entailed in the early days before power washers. 
When the pontoon was lifting the trawler out of the water 2 squads of men in 2 punts would scrub the hull with hard bristle sweeping brushes to get rid of the barnacles and mussels attached to the hull. The pontoon worked by opening valves to let the water into the tanks to sink the pontoon.  Once the pontoon was sunk and vessel positioned in place the water was pumped out and the pontoon and vessel came out of the water. 
The pontoon was broken up at Dales Drydock in the early 2000s? When Albert Quay was being refurbished and the fishing industry was in decline and was no longer needed.

Glasgow Herald, 11/4/1953:
AHC accept a tender of £74,850 for an all welded replacement No. 1 Pontoon.

Aberdeen Evening Express, 18/3/1955:
New Pontoon Dock - Preparations are being made for the new pontoon dock which will take the place of No. 1 dock at Albert Quay. Uprights are being put in the berth, and a dredger has been busy.
It is understood that the old dock will take her last lift about the twenty-second of this month. Thereafter she will be removed so that the berth will be cleared for the new dock which, I understand, will be launched early next month from the yard of Messrs John Lewis and Sons, Ltd., Torry.
While on the subject of pontoon docks, I understand that the next one which will require attention will be No. 3, the large one at Footdee.
The suggestion here is that it should be replaced by a graving dock somewhere about Pocra. This would require certain alterations being carried out at that part of the harbour.
If a graving dock is built in the course of time it will not be the first. Many people will remember the old graving dock situated where the deep-water berth is today.
That dock gave yeomen service for many years and it was so well built that it took much longer to remove than was anticipated.

Aberdeen Evening Express, 06/05/1955:
New Pontoon Dock - The new pontoon dock at Albert Quay is now in commission, the first vessel to go on being the trawler Dandara which was having her hull repainted. The old pontoon dock has been removed to the sandy beach at Old Torry where it is being broken up. This task is not expected to be completed until about the end of this month."

'The Abergeldie of Aberdeen, a clipper ship, was lost in the China Seas in very bad weather.  The crew were said to have been saved.'

Glasgow Herald, 04/09/1854:
ABERGELDIE, Capt. Brock, which foundered in Gaspar Straits 17 June, was bound for Hong Kong. She left London 5 March with cargo of lead, sheathing copper and Manchester goods. On 17 June as evening was setting in, with a slight breeze abeam, she struck on a reef about 1½ miles off north end of Pulo Leal in Gaspar Seas and hung, making water. Soundings abaft gave 3½ fathoms, amidships 2 fathoms. The whole of the chain cables and some of cargo were hoisted out of forehold and taken right aft. with hope of lightening ship forward sufficiently to allow her to slip off. But all efforts were unavailing and on sounding the well six feet of water was found and it was evident nothing could be done to save the ship.  The boats were got out and the next day the crew abandoned ship and were picked up by the EUPHRATES, for Bombay.  They were afterwards transferred to the CHALLENGER, 111 days from England, which landed them at Hong Kong 3 July.

Aberdeen Free Press, 18/5/1869:
Clipper Race from Aberdeen to London - Two fine clippers set sail from this port for London on Thursday afternoon, almost simultaneously. They were the ABERGELDIE, built by Messrs Duthie, and the CENTURION, built by Messrs Walter Hood and Company, both of which were launched a short time ago. The ABERGELDIE under command of Captain Howling, her own master no having yet joined the ship, was towed out of the dock first, and left the harbour amid enthusiastic cheering from the shore, a hearty response coming from those on board. The CENTURION, Captain Mitchell, followed in a few minutes, and was likewise cheered as she passed the dock gates. A considerable crowd had assembled on the pier-head for the purpose of seeing the vessels spread their sails to the wind, which was very favourable, and no little interest was manifested in the race to London. We have received information that the ABERGELDIE was docked at London ""all well"", on Monday morning at 3:20am, at which time the CENTURION had not arrived.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 11/02/1884:
A Lloyd's telegram announces that the ship ""ABERGELDIE"" of Aberdeen has put back to Sydney in a disabled condition.  Her foremast was sprung and she had lost main topgallant yard, fore topsail yard and some sails and spars.  She will probably repair afloat without discharging.  Cost of repairs is estimated at £800.

Australian Town & County Journal, 14/2/1885:
As some return for the kindness shown them during their stay in Sydney, Captain and Mrs Johnston of ship ABERGELDIE, lying at the Circular Quay, gave a dance aboard. About 60 persons were present, the gentlemen being principally representatives of the shipping interests of the port. Vessel was handsomely decorated with flags and evergreens, and the deck, over which an awning had been spread, made a capital ballroom.  Dancing to an excellent string band started shortly after 8pm and was kept up until the early hours.

Ship ABERGELDIE of Aberdeen collided with barge ALDBOROUGH, with lime, off Barking, River Thames.  Barge had rigging damaged.  ABERGELDIE grounded, but floated at high water and proceeded in tow.

Aberdeen Press & Journal, 4/11/1889:
Loss of an Aberdeen Sailing Vessel - Yesterday a Lloyd's telegram from Christiansand was received in Aberdeen to the effect that the sailing vessel ABERGELDIE of this port, Lawrie, master, bound from London for Sundsvall with iron, was sunk after collision with the steamer EDEN of West Hartlepool (Captain Fawitt). The S.S. EDEN managed to rescue the crew of the ABERGELDIE, 18 in number, and afterwards landed them in Mandal. The ABERGELDIE, which is a vessel of 1151 tons register, was built in Aberdeen in 1869 by Messrs J. Duthie, Sons and Co., Footdee, and was an exceptionally strong ship, one of the most costly wooden vessels ever built in Aberdeen. The wood of which she was composed was nearly all teak, she being also fitted with and iron hold and deck beam. About two years ago she was reclassed to No.A1 survey at Lloyd's for eleven years. Up to within three months ago the ABERGELDIE was the property of her builders, Messrs J. Duthie, Sons & Co., when she was purchased by Messrs J. Rust & Sons, timber merchants. Owing to the vessel being at the time of purchase in the London docks, and the ""Dockers"" coming out on strike, it was found impossible to get her cargo discharged until about a month ago, at which date she was formally handed over to the Messrs Rust. Only about three weeks ago the same vessel collided with the barge ALDBOROUGH off Barking, on the river Thames. Though the ABERGELDIE at that time took the ground, she was got off at high water with very little damage. After undergoing the necessary repairs, she sailed from London on 23rd October for Sundsvall and Melbourne, and it was while off the Norwegian coast that the present collision occurred. Several of the crew, it is stated, belong to Aberdeen.

Newcastle [NSW] Morning Herald, 13/11/1889:
Ship ABERGELDIE changed hands on her arrival in London last voyage and was chartered to load timber in Sweden for Adelaide. She sailed from London in ballast, and all went well until nearly across the North Sea, when she collided with a vessel whose name is unknown and foundered immediately. She was formerly one of the famous Duthie line, was a regular wool trader to Sydney, and was well known for her fast passages under Captains Robertson, Crombie and Johnston. No information to hand of safety of crew."

Aberdeen Press & Journal, 12/5/1875:
Launch of a Steamer - A beautifully modelled vessel, the latest addition to the fleet owned by Messrs Adam & Company, was successfully launched from the building yard to Messrs John Duthie, Sons & Company, Footdee, on Wednesday, the ceremony of naming her the ABOYNE being performed by Mrs Cook, the captain's mother. The dimensions of the this vessel are as follows: Length, 183ft 6in; breadth moulded, 26ft; depth, 14ft 9in; carrying capacity, about 800 tons. She will be fitted with compound engines by Messrs Hall, Russell, & Company, and will have all the latest improvements both in hull and machinery. She is double riveted throughout, and specially strengthened beyond the requirements of Lloyd's. The ABOYNE is the fourth vessel built by the Messrs Duthie for the same firm, and we understand is intended for general trades, probably proceeding on her first voyage to Archangel, under the command of Captain Alexander Cook, late of the S.S. DON, belonging to the same firm.

Aberdeen Journal, 21/6/1876: 
'Telegram received from British consul in Archangel that steamer Aboyne, belonging to this port, had gone ashore in consequence of ice and fog off Cross Island.  Captain feared she would become total wreck, fore hold being full of water...Aboyne left Archangel on 14th inst. with cargo of oats for Aberdeen...she is commanded by Captain Cook.'

Launch of a Trawler - There was launched yesterday from the shipbuilding yard of Messrs. John Duthie, Sons, and Company, Footdee, a finely modelled steam trawler, built to the order of the Caledonian Steam Trawling Company, Limited, Aberdeen. The dimensions of the vessel are: Length, 125 feet; breadth, 21 feet 6 inches; and depth, 12 feet 6 inches. The vessel had a gross tonnage of 200, and she will be fitted with triple expansion engines by Messrs. Lidgerwood and Company, engineers, Coatbridge. The launch was very successful, and as the trawler left the ways she was christened the ABOYNE by Mrs Turner, wife of Capt. Turner, who will command the vessel. After the launch the company adjourned to the office of Messrs Duthie, where a cake and wine banquet took place, and a few toasts were pledged."

Aberdeen Press and Journal, 15/2/1910:
The Explosion on an Aberdeen Trawler - A Lisbon telegram reports an explosion of fire damp aboard the British steamer ABOYNE, in the Tagus, which tore a hole in the deck of the vessel. The ABOYNE sank. Nine sailors were injured, five seriously. On inquiry at the local agents yesterday - Messrs Smith, Jameson and Holmes - it was ascertained that the only information received by them was to the effect that an explosion had occurred, blowing up the decks. The sailing master in an Aberdeen man named Frederick Brown. The mate also belongs to Aberdeen. The remainder of the crew, it is understood, are Portuguese. The ABOYNE was recently chartered by a Lisbon firm.

Aberdeen Press and Journal, 17/2/1910:
The Explosion on the Trawler ABOYNE: Has the Vessel Sunk? - Messrs Smith, Jameson and Holmes, the Aberdeen agents for the trawler ABOYNE, on which an explosion occurred at Lisbon last week, have received a number of brief messages from the sailing master, Frederick Brown, but in contradiction of the report that the vessel had sunk, no mention is made in any of them of such an occurrence. Late on Monday evening a message was received in Aberdeen giving an estimate of the damage done, and the figure was so low that, were the estimate accurate, it absolutely precludes any possibility of the report that the vessel had sunk being correct. As there are several matters involved, no definite statement can be obtained at present from Lisbon."

Deaths - at Cape of Good Hope about end of January last, William Weir, Mate of barque ACASTA, of Aberdeen, in 51st year of his age.

Glasgow Herald, 21/05/1855:
Barque ACASTA, from Shanghai to London, spoken 2 May, Lat 44.28N, Long 30.54W (Mid Atlantic between Newfoundland and Bay of Biscay).

Caledonian Mercury, 16/01/1857:
Barque ACASTA, Capt. Ahier, arrived in River Clyde from the Mauritius on afternoon of New Year's Day, she was in charge of Daniel McCormick, an old and experienced deep-sea pilot. He dropped anchor within the buoy off the West Harbour [Greenock] and ran a hawser out to the buoy to keep ship steady so that she might not interrupt the channel... generally the ship was tailing down the river. About 5 o'clock following morning the Irish mail steamer ELK arrived from Belfast and in approaching quay struck ACASTA on port quarter. Capt. Ahier was charged in Police Court of breach in Harbour Act on grounds light was not properly displayed.  Great no. of shipowners were present, who seemed to watch proceedings with great interest. Issues were whether bye-laws of harbour applied in the channel, whether Capt. Ahier was responsible when pilot in charge and whether light shown was sufficiently visible. Bailie's judgement was that, as mate of ELK had admitted he was the only one on look-out on forecastle deck, this and the steamer going at too great a speed was the cause of the collision. Capt. Ahier, being a stranger, had put himself in charge of an old and experienced pilot.

A pilot board enquiry into the grounding of ship ADA on 20 Feb. John Jones, master of ship ADA, 686 tons, bound London-Melbourne, deponed pilot Ridley took charge about 3.30 or 4 outside the heads. We passed west channel lighthouse about 5.30 or 6 and were near Cellibrand lightship about 8, with all sails clued up, ready for anchoring. We passed lighthouse at speed of about 4 knots, pilot being on forecastle. Lead was not going when pilot gave orders to starboard and, vessel not answering; this was 1st intimation of her being on the ground. Hove lead amidships - 17ft water, ship drawing 16'9"". I requested Mr. Ridley to procure a steam tug, which he did about 9 o'clock. Tug MYSTERY got to work about 10, but did not succeed up to 11. Ship was aground between beacon buoy and St. Kilda bank. At 11 got assistance of another steamer, REOLUTE - no success on port quarter, but when shifted to other quarter succeeded in about an hour to get vessel off bank, and ADA was brought into the bay. Pilot was perfectly sober and attentive all the time, but I do not think captain of MYSTERY paid proper attention to his orders. Mr Ridley called out several times to him to try to move to southward, but no attention was paid to him. Pilot board found grounding of ADA took place from want of proper vigilance on part of pilot Ridley and the non heaving of the lead, for which culpable negligence board suspended hi license for 3 months.

South Australian Register (Adelaide) 17/9/1877:
ADELAIDE arrived some time ago under sail & after dismantling and refitting she was ready for her trial trip 15 Sept. She was built from plans and furnished in the colony. According to writer more powerful than her predecessor, but without her symmetry. Being adapted for more than towage, she has a fine oven deck, a very good after cabin and fore cabin, with fore and aft cargo holds. Cabin furnished with centre tables and settees, with dining accommodation for 30 plus ceiling picked out with gold mouldings. In fore end is ladies cabin, master's berth and steward's pantry. From towing horse aft it quite clear except for 2 portable towing bridges. Midship compartment is entirely devoted to engines and boilers. Machinery is of most modern mode and described as especially suited to river and towing work. When novelty of compound-surface condensers is worn away these will be as easily worked as the older type. Paddles are of feathering type. High pressure cylinder is of 26"" diameter and 2 low pressure cylinders 32"", with 4'6"" stroke.

Adelaide Observer, 15/6/1929:
About 40 years ago there were 3 steam paddle tugs in port Adelaide. When they were displaced by more modern tugs, ADELAIDE was turned into a hulk.

Port Pirie Recorder, 15/11/1930:
For some years old paddle-wheel steamer ADELAIDE was this port's principal tug. The engines were described by those in authority as the most weird and wonderful collection of machinery seen on Australian coast and chief engineer Butler was believed to be the only man in the world who could understand them. ADELAIDE'S skipper, Captain Medland was a most zealous officer, but apt to get rattled at times. In addition to her towage duties, ADELAIDE was the most comfortable passenger steamer of her kind, which ran excursions frequently to Port Augusta and Port Germein."

Torbay, 11 December - Brig AGNES, Capt. Robert Barclay, sailed for Jamaica.

Caledonian Mercury, 12/7/1821:
At about 1:30am on 24 April brig AGNES, Robert Barclay master, New Orleans - Greenock, collided with brig UNION, Capt. Henry in Lat. 48.24, Long 25.0. AGNES was carrying full cargo of cotton and received so much damage that she went down in a short time. Crew and passengers (14 in number) got into the long boat, but with loss of all they had save what was on their backs. Morning is said to have been very dark, vessels were on opposite tacks and neither party saw the other until it was too late. All agree not the smallest blame can attach to either. Captain Barclay will sail in about 10 or 12 days [from Quebec] in new brig ELEANOR, of which he has got command, for Greenock."

The Royal Navy petty officer on watch on board HMS Medina, and therefore  committed suicide following the accident, although his name was not mentioned in press reports.

The wreck of the AGNES BLAIKIE has been discovered and is being dived by a Russian diving crew. Since 2006 the Underwater Heritage Department of Ukraine decided to take the shipwreck under its protection, to install a memorial tablet and to regulate dives on it.

Mystery of a British Sailer by Alexander Lyutenkov:
According to the Lloyd's Register, this was a merchant sailing vessel built in 1841 in Aberdeen on the Walter Hood shipyard. The Aberdeen Lines owned the sailboat until 1849, and her expedition to Cuba in 1843 is reflected in the archives. Her next owner was W. Jenkins & Co., and according to 1853 entry, the vessel was owned by a certain Mr. Dobbin of Bristol, who used it on the Australian lanes. In 1854 the Agnes Blaikie, as many other ships, was chartered by the British Government for servicing the Crimea military campaign. The route was as follows: England - Malta - the Crimea. The Agnes Blaikie left Britain for Malta with the war cargo on board. According to the information of British historians, the Agnes remained in Malta for two months. During that time the ship changed the captain and, most probably, the cargo. Accordingly, the vessel could leave for Balaklava with an unspecified cargo. To identify it was the main task of the divers who examined the holds. Most probably, it was stowed with some military equipment or provisions, because shipping of the food supplies from Malta was a routine practice. I can assure you that the Agnes Blaikie had nothing to do with the sunken gold, which was sought for on the Black Prince.
          - In what circumstances was Agnes lost?
There was a collision in the Balaklava bay with the naval hydrographic ship Medina. It was a paddle-wheeled steam-boat, nearly 3 times as big as the sailer. Therefore the latter had very scanty chances of surviving. Recently we came across a news item in The Times, related to those events. There they say that immediately after the accident the watch officer of HMS Medina committed suicide. Such were the sense of responsibility and the professional honour obligations in the British navy 150 years ago. The circumstances of the tragedy are still unknown. The ship's journal of the Medina could cast some light on them, and our British helpmates have been actively involved in it. By the way, the steamer herself served Her Majesty Royal Navy for another 9 years.
          -How long did the sailing last?
In January 1855 the Agnes Blaikie left the British Isles and by about early May reached Balaklava. Oh, yes, ships were not very fast as that time. But it should not be forgotten that it was a sailing vessel, which moved by the wind and fully depended on its strength and direction. However, that was the time, when the steam engine actively started to force the sail out from the sea, and the collision of the Agnes Blaikie brig with the Medina steamer became a tragic symbol of this process.
          -They say the bell had a somewhat unusual shape?
Yes, the English fleet historian from Aberdeen, Mr. Stuart Rhiner, has marked on the pictures sent to him this non-characteristic peculiarity of the bell assembly lashing. Usually it was made of straight beams, and in this case it has a somewhat intricate and, I would say, artistically elaborated shape.
          -What can you say with regard to the version that it was not ships, but a church bell?
You know, this is a very original version, but there is no support under it at all. It should be noted that divers in general are people with very rich imaginations. I repeat it once again: according to the expert comments, this is a standard ships bell with a somewhat unusual bracketry. And its position is standard for the sailing vessels of this type - at the bow, but not at the stern. The elements of an ornamentation and decoration are generally typical for the Agnes. Thus, for example, ornaments have been found at the stem and in the holds. Perhaps, it is just connected with the story of the vessel's name origination, or with the fact that it was cargo-and passenger vessel and for this reason required a certain gloss.
And one more interesting moment. There used to be a concept of the Aberdeen forecastle. At first it appeared on the Scottish Maid sailer in 1839 and since then this feature gradually spread throughout the world. The Aberdeen forecastle is a splayed stem. And the prehistory of this innovation is the following: at that time taxes in England depended on the holds dimensions. Thus, when they splayed the stem, the capacity of the holds decreased and the performance of the vessel improved. This innovation became widely spread on the famous tea clippers, for which speed was of the most importance. The Agnes Blaikie still had a standard stem. It could be explained by the fact that only two years had passed from the introduction of this configuration, and perhaps those who ordered the boat had some other reasons, to prefer a larger capacity to speed.
          -How definite can it be asserted that the Agnes lying near Balaklava is compatible with the documents you have found? Perhaps could there possibly be two vessels with the same name?
You know, there are too many coincidences. Of course, in the merchant fleets, unlike in the navy, there were examples when two vessels had identical names at the same time. But according to the Lloyd's register, in the period under consideration no vessels with such a name were registered, except the above mentioned one. There were some other Agnes’s, but no Blaikie!
It is interesting to note that at the end of December, 1854 The Times published a report about the loading in the Royal Arsenal docks of a chartered Agnes Blakey. She was to ship to the Crimea 180 tons of cannon-balls and 250 tons of coal. At first we were confused by the weight of the cargo, which did not keep in line with the Agnes Blaikie 381 tons displacement, and by the name spelling difference. But when in other sources we found information on the dates of sailing of our sailer and studied different British systems of calculating the tonnage and carrying capacity, we became convinced that it is the same boat! And the distorted name, most likely, appeared because the reporter wrote it down as he had heard it.
But there is one more interesting thing: according to the same Lloyd's register, up to 1853 the Agnes was registered as a bark, but here we clearly have a brig. The principal difference lies in the fact that a bark has three masts, while a brig - two. According to comments of British experts, the vessel could be re-equipped in the course of its exploitation. For a well trained crew it presented no particular problem even in sailing, and there was no necessity to go to a dock for it. The rig was adapted to the sailing conditions.
          -And what can you say about the ships name origin?
Agnes Blaikie is a real name, it belonged to the wife of Sir Thomas Blaikie, then the Mayor of Aberdeen. His daughter had that name, too. Though it might be a mere coincidence, it is difficult to assert anything for sure, because there are no supporting documents.
          -How many people suffered in the ships wreck?
As far as we know, no one of the crew was lost. There is a report saying that the crew got their wages in full and joined another ship. There was no explosion, but the vessel received the hole; while the hull was gradually filling with water, the crew had the time to abandon it. The initial version asserting that the Agnes sank during the storm in November 1854 has not been confirmed. The date of the vessels wreck is 5th or 8th of May, 1855. The post factum report of 1856 testifies to the fact that all vessels documents were lost in the wreck. A persistent tendency has been obvious; the military both now and then do their best to conceal accidents, and for this reason there are so few materials concerning investigation of the vessels wreck. Besides, should the Agnes had sunk in the waters under the British control, then the investigation of circumstances and reasons would have been conducted by Lloyd as the principal insurer; but in the Crimea in that time nobody considered it serious enough - a war is a war.
In the conclusion I would like to note that Agnes Blaikie is probably the only sailer in its class which has been so well-preserved in its primeval appearance. Probably, this is due to the fact that it was made of highly quality wood species - mainly of oak - and therefore had 9A1 classification, the highest for that moment.
         -And what is the case with a Maltese brig?
There are reports about the ships, which sank in the Crimea near Balaklava, Kacha and Yevpatoria during the storm of November 14, 1854. There we found one more interesting artefact; in a number of lists a certain Maltese merchant brig is mentioned. It is not a name but the identity of the country. That made me glad and I began to search. I found a great-great-grandson of the ship-owner, he is an Englishman and lives on Corfu. His great-great-grandfather lived in Malta, and his father was a prominent businessman. And this young man of 14 - George Moor, Jnr. graduated from a college and went to the Crimean was; he performed a clerk's duty on a British naval ship. he borrowed from his father 5,000 pounds (presently is it about 3 million pounds), bought or rented a merchant ship, loaded it with some goods and shipped to the Crimea. According to the family legend, this vessel sank, but it is unknown when and how. Some letters of relatives telling of this sad story have been preserved. But it is not the established fact that this wreck took place exactly during the 1854 storm. It is quite possible that it is this brig that is lying on the bottom of the Balaklava bay. Then the story of the Agnes Blaikie will have to be continued!

Number 32 in 1826 Register of Shipping held at Aberdeen City Archives.

""The longest running regular passage service from Aberdeen to Halifax, Canada, was the one offered by Robert Duthie's 'Albion'. She did regular crossings with emigrants, often twice yearly, and the Captain was always Alexander Leslie.

Captain Alexander Leslie had an incredibly long association with the Brig 'Albion' of Aberdeen. Twenty three years between 1829 - 1853 taking passengers most years. Leslie's long experience clearly gave him high standing and, on one occasion immediately after the Spring crossing of 1836, his passengers left us an account of the importance of a Captain's skill and humanity; it was published both in the Halifax Journal and the Aberdeen Journal: ""We the Cabin passengers of the brig 'Albion' of Aberdeen, Alexander Leslie Master, avail ourselves of the earliest opportunity of expressing through the medium of your respectable paper our unanimous testimony to the unremitted assiduity with which Captain Leslie attended to our comfort during a tedious, stormy passage. While we do not presume that we can add to the character which Captain Leslie has long since earned, and fully established on both sides of the Atlantic; we deem it a debt of gratitude due to him thus publicly to express our approbation of his conduct and we would strongly recommend to emigrants and others crossing the Atlantic to do so by the 'Albion', as from experience we can assure them that under the command of Captain Leslie the greatest care will be paid to their comfort and safety"".

1829 In March she carried 18 emigrants to Halifax 13 as cabin passengers paying £7 each, the rest, 13, in steerage. (The Albion's steerage was said to be ""comfortably fitted up with a stove"" and to have ""plenty of height"").

In March 1831 carried 17 passengers to Halifax
In March 1832 carried 31 passengers to Halifax
In March 1833 carried 26 passengers to Halifax
In August 1833 carried 31 passengers to Halifax

An advertisement in the Aberdeen Journal, November 1826 for the sale of the Albion's timber stated as follows: MIRAMICHI TIMBER. There will be sold by public roup, upon an early day, to be afterwards fixed, The Entire Cargo of the Brig ALBION, Capt Leslie, just arrived from Miramichi consisting of 320 loads of YELLOW PINE - 12 loads of BIRCH - 1400 superfical feet FIR PLANK; and 2,550 ASH BILLETS STAVES. The above cargo is of excellent quality, and of very large scantling. It may be seen on the piece of ground belonging to Messrs Duffus & Co adjoining Footdee Church Yard; and further particulars can be known on applying to ROBERT DUTHIE Quay, Nov.7 1826.

Another advertisement for her Spring departure in 1828 was as follows:

For HALIFAX, PICTOU, and MIRAMICHI. The fine new and fast sailing Brig ALBION, 266 tons per register, Alex. Leslie, Commander, will be ready to receive Goods on board for the above ports in the course of a few days, and will positively be dispatched on first March.  The accommodation for Cabin and Steerage Passengers is superior, having good height between decks. For Freight and Passage, apply to Captain Leslie or to Robt. Duthie who has for Sale, 15,000 feet Miramichi Timber of fine quality, imported in November last, per the ALBION. Also for sale 100 Barrels Belfast Prime MESS PORK, newly cured. (One concern.) Quay, Jan. 15 1828.

In July 1836, on a return journey to Aberdeen, the Albion carried timber from Miramichi which was due to be sold by public auction ""on the links adjoining the works of the Aberdeen Rope and Sail Company"".

Brig ALEXANDER, Booth master, of Aberdeen, for St. John's, New Brunswick, put back to Loch Foyle, near Derry on 1 May, having on 25th April been taken in lat. 54.16, long. 18 with a violent gale of wind from N.W., with hail, rain and heavy sea. As vessel laid to under close reefed main topsail, brig was struck by a dreadful sea, which threw her on her beam ends. Two successive waves swept away boats, bulwarks, cook-house, stanchions and everything on deck. Passengers' berths and great part of their provisions were destroyed. Many of passengers (of which there were 140 aboard) broke out into acts of insubordination, so that it became necessary to return with the vessel, some of the emigrants proving to be of the most base and profligate character.

Sydney Morning Herald, 02/09/1867:
David Peragrin and William Hall, seamen on ship ""ALEXANDER DUTHIE"", were convicted of having during voyage from London to Sydney, embezzled 2 cases of Brandy, part of the cargo. They had been in irons 51 days. No wages due to them and sentenced to 6 weeks imprisonment.

Aberdeen Journal, 13/11/1867:
Arrived at Sydney on 30th August after a splendid run of 75 days, left Gravesend on 12/6/1867, passed Plymouth on 15th, crossed equator on 9/7/1867.

Illustrated Sydney News, Saturday 16th November 1867:
The wool season has now fairly set in, and with it the activity which characterises the London liners at this period of the year. The Brucklay Castle took the first shipment of the New. Clip, and was followed by the Strathdon. 
The splendid new clipper Alexander Duthie, which recently made the passage from the London Docks to Sydney in 78 days, took over 3000 bales, and made the largest freight ever earned in one voyage by a ship from this port. 
Prior to sailing, Captain Douglas celebrated the maiden trip of his fine vessel by a ball. The spacious quarter-deck was for the nonce converted into a salle de danse, with walls of many hued-bunting and canopy of canvas. Chinese lanterns of every conceivable design furnished light, and festoons of evergreens and garlands of flowers hung round the walls, lent additional beauty to the scene. In the poop the tables groaned beneath choice refections, sparkling wines, and other descriptions of creature comforts, while the side cabins formed the neatest of dressing and card rooms. 
Dancing commenced about 8 o'clock, and both Captain Douglas and Mr. Murfit, the chief officer, exerted themselves indefatigably to make their 150 guests at home. The band must have felt it a relief when supper was announced. The latter was by no means the least satisfactory of the arrangements, and ere it concluded the health of Captain Douglas and a successful future to the good ship Alexander-Duthie, was drunk with all the honours. Captain Douglas, in responding, thanked the ladies and gentlemen present for the very flattering manner in which the toast had been proposed and responded to, and expressed his satisfaction that on this, his first voyage to Sydney, he should have met with greater kindness than in any port he had ever visited, and he was sure that it would be satisfactory to all present to know that his voyage promised to be one of the most remunerative ever made by any vessel that ever left the port. He hoped that the friendships formed here would be pleasurably renewed on many future occasions; and should he have the honour of conveying any of the residents of Sydney to the mother country, he hoped to earn from them as warm expressions of satisfaction and esteem as his passengers on the outward voyage had been kind enough to place on record. 
In conclusion he asked the company to join in a bumper to the health of a sailor who had that day arrived in the colonies, and who, though a Prince, was one who was every inch a British seaman, and by his proficiency in his profession had fairly earned his rank. The health of his Royal Highness Prince Alfred was then enthusiastically drunk. Dancing was then resumed, and unflaggingly sustained until Old Sol, peeping through the east, told the revelers it was time to go. The Walter Hood sailed a few days after the Alexander Duthie, and the Strathnaver is now ready for sea, leaving the Agnes Rose, Swiftsure, General Lee, and Caldbeck partly loaded.


Sydney Morning Herald, 04/03/1869:
[Advertisement] To Captain A. Douglas - we passengers on your good ship, acknowledge unvarying kindness and consideration shown for our comfort and happiness. You have had much to harass and annoy you, constantly interrupted by contrary winds and calms, prolonging voyage which could have been performed in little over half the time. [off San Francisco 10/11/1868].

Sydney Morning Herald, 19/04/1884:
For considerable time past great anxiety at Sydney and at home for well-known Aberdeen clipper ship ""ALEXANDER DUTHIE"" [Melbourne Argus 29/04/1884 reported she had been posted missing at Lloyd's]. She left Sydney early 1883 for Manilla with cargo of coal. Just heard ship has safely arrived Liverpool and that her long voyage was due to calms. The many friends of Capt. Donald and his officers in this port will be pleased to hear of their safety.

Melbourne Argus, 12/08/1887:
In District Court Francis W. Tardiff sued Alexander W. Cregeen, Master of ""ALEXANDER DUTHIE"", for £37 wages alleged due as cook and steward. He was engaged at Puget Sound, Canada, for voyage to Melbourne at rate of 9 dollars per week, but 40 days out he was taken out of the galley and set to work before the mast. At Melbourne Captain only designed to pay him £9, which he refused. Defence was that plaintiff was utterly incompetent as a cook and exceedingly filthy in his habits, so that neither Captain nor men could eat the food he provided. Bench made order for £26.10.4.

Massacre of English sailors - it appears that the Captain and a boat's crew of the English ship ALEXANDRINA of London had occasion to go ashore near Punta Arenas (Chile) and that... they came into conflict with the Indians, who murdered them.  The Indians then put off in large numbers in their canoes towards the ALEXANDRINA, but those on board made all possible sail on the vessel and succeeded in saving themselves and the ship.  The body of the Captain was afterwards discovered with two severe wounds on the body and both legs cut off.  No traces could be found of the boat's crew, but an English war steamer was expected to proceed to the coast and inquire into the tragedy.

Aberdeen Journal, 11/09/1833:
'On the Yorkshire coast, the gale was tremendous, with piercing cold, and showers of hail - the sea running mountains high - so as to afford no chance of clearning the land to vessels engaged with that dangerous part of the coast, so much exposed to north-east storms; and we lament to state the melancholy fate of an Aberdeen vessel so situated. The brig ALFRED, Forbes, which had sailed, coal laden, from Shields for this place, on the 30 uit (August), was afterwards driven to the southward, and, between 4 and 5 o'clock next day, was observed standing towards the harbour of Whitby, within about three fourths of a mile of which, the vessel broached to by a heavy sea, which broke on board, bringing the main-topsail, at the same time, aback when, melancholy to relate, she immediately went down with her unfortunate crew, seven in number! Part of the wreck was afterwards cast ashore, particularly a plank of the stern with the name 'ALFRED OF ABERDEEN'. Great praise... Lifeboat with Capt. Manby's apparatus was readied and witnessed the wreck with most painful feelings..."

Three of crew stabbed Second Mate (Officer of Watch), supercargo and a passenger to death and forced remainder of crew to surrender. Capt. MacNally, trapped in his cabin, would at first not surrender. Then he made a deal with the mutineers that he would show them their course if he was allowed to take away in the gig two women aboard (the murdered passenger's wife and her maid). Captain gave them course, but was then murdered and thrown overboard. Mutineers distributed the gold among the crew, found the wine and became intoxicated. Next night loyal members of crew, led by Jan Smit, fell upon mutineers in the dark and killed them.  Vessel reached Honolulu 12 Oct. All loyal members of crew brought to cabin money which had been distributed to them and it was taken charge of by British Consul. Jan Smit has been presented with £1100 and valuable sextant by insurance companies.

Aberdeen Press & Journal, 17/2/1858:
Launch - On Monday, there was launched from the building yard of Messrs David Burns & Co., on the Inches, a clipper brig, named the ""ANN LAW."" Her tonnage is 184 register, 247 builders measurement. The ""ANN LAW"" is for local owners; she is the first vessel launched by the present firm (though Mr Burns' ability and experience are well known), to whom she does very great credit.

Aberdeen Herald, 20/2/1858:
A handsome clipper-brig of about 180 tons was launched on Tuesday from the building yard of Messrs. Burns & Co., Inches. Shortly before two o'clock, a large number of spectators had assembled on the quays immediately opposite, and the usual christening ceremony having been gracefully performed by one of the lady owners, the ""ANN LAW"" descended beautifully into the water. Her appearance afloat is everything that could be desired as regards symmetry, and we may hope that her sailing qualities will at once do credit to the builders and the port, already justly celebrated for its naval architecture. After the launch, the owners and builders favoured with the presence of several ladies, entertained a select number of their friends to wine and cake, and the future success of the ""ANN LAW"" was duly pledged, and heartily responded to.

Shortly after leaving port very heavy gales were experienced, Sunday 21 October while ship was hove to the jib boom and nearly whole of head gear was carried away and heavy seas caused vessel to strain very much. Pumps had to be kept going constantly. Later in voyage another storm came on and main topsail had to be cut away to ease the ship. She lay off the Girdleness from Sunday till Thursday morning and when port was reached crew were in very exhausted condition. Brig is commanded by Capt. Hamilton.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 30/09/1878:
Aberdeen brig ANN LAW, belonging to Mr. James Tulloch, Jr., and commanded by Capt. Moscrop, arrived Aberdeen yesterday, having left Archangel 11 July with cargo of tar. She was expected about middle of August and no little anxiety was felt. She had encountered pretty rough weather, part of deck cargo having been washed away, but no material damage to rigging or hull.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 21/03/1879:
Brig ANN LAW, in ballast Aberdeen - Leith, went ashore early yesterday morning at North Berwick in very foggy weather, with assistance of tug she was got off and proceeded to Leith. Believed vessel has very little damage. 

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 07/05/1880:
Aberdeen vessel dismasted - brig ANN LAW (Hamilton Captain and Owner) was towed into Aberdeen with her mainmast gone.  Captain reports that at Sunderland, while loading, the cargo of lime burned the mast about 3 feet below deck. Mast was cut off to save more serious damage and ship towed to Aberdeen by tug CRUSADER.

Aberdeen Free Press, 07/05/1880:
Dimsasted vessel towed into Aberdeen harbour - Yesterday afternoon the brig ANN LAW, of Aberdeen, Captain Hamilton, arrived in Aberdeen harbour in tow of the steam tug CRUSADER, of Sunderland. The vessel was being laden, at Sunderland, with lime for the Aberdeen Commercial Company, when by some means or other the lime in the hold became slaked and one of the masts below the deck was burned, and had to be cut by the board. The brig was then towed to Aberdeen, where she arrived, as above stated, in the course of the afternoon.

Aberdeen Press and Journal, 22/10/1881:
Loss of an Aberdeen schooner. Intelligence has just reached Aberdeen of the total loss of the schooner ANN LAW, of this port. On Monday morning a telegram, dated Flushing, 16th inst., was received at Aberdeen by Mrs Hamilton, wife of the master of the vessel, intimating that the vessel had been lost, but that the lives of the crew had been saved. No further particulars have as yet come to hand. The ANN LAW left Keennetpans, Firth of Forth, on 29th September, with a cargo of coals for Fee champ, and it is conjectured that, being caught in the recent disastrous storm, the vessel had been driven out of her course and become a total wreck. The ANN LAW, which was a vessel of 185 tons, belonged to the master, Mr G. W. Hamilton, and is, we believe, partly insured. She was built in Aberdeen in 1858, being brig rigged, but in May 1880, she took fire while being laden with lime at Sunderland, and was subsequently repaired and converted into a schooner.
Full particulars have now reached Aberdeen regarding the loss of the schooner ANN LAW of this port. The schooner drove from the Goodwin Sands in a north-westerly gale which lasted for three days, during which the most of her sails were rent to pieces. On the third day the master tried to make Gravelines, but no pilot would venture aboard, and as night approached the danger of grounding on the deceptive sand banks being apparent, the vessel was perforce put about again, and stood away for about five mile from the shore. At this time a tremendous sea was running, which drove the vessel aground and with the shock then sustained the rudder was unshipped, and the stern post carried away by the force of the waves. The decks were swept fore and aft, the galley was dashed overboard, great stretches of the bulwarks and rails carried away, the heavy seas likewise smashed the long boat, and doing a deal of minor damage. The crew, after the vessel had grounded, lost no time in getting the small boat launched and having got crowded into her with difficulty they made for the shore. About four o'clock in the morning the keel of the boat grated on the beach, but the heavy surf immediately upset her and pitched the crew into the water, and it was only by dint of dexterous swimming that they reached the land at all. Nothing of consequence was saved from the wreck, and since the ship foundered there was constantly being washed up on the beach a vast quantity of wreckage, much of which is said to belong to other vessels that have gone ashore during the recent disastrous gale. The master, G. W. Hamilton and mate, William Taylor, arrived in London in a very exhausted condition on Wednesday, the crew having gone there on the previous day. No lives are lost."

This vessel was well known as a clipper on the Australia trade carrying cargo and passengers and was the flagship of the Aberdeen White Star Line.

On her maiden voyage she sailed from London to Port Phillip, Australia in 74 days and once made 320 miles in 24 hours.

28th May 1903 Left Caleta Buena, Chile for San Francisco with a cargo of nitrate and soda and, despite searches, was never heard of again.

The Colonial Clippers, Basil Lubbock, p.231:
States that when the Aberdeen Line sold off their clippers, as a result of Lloyd's raising the insurance rates for sailing ships, ARISTIDES was retained and became their last sailer, but the SALAMIS, PERICLES and STRATHDON all outlived her in the fleet.

Daily News, 03/07/1885:
Capt. Kemball of the ship ARISTIDES, which sailed from Melbourne 16th February for London and arrived 31 May, reports having seen the ship NORTH AMERICAN, now missing, on 27 Feb Lat. 45.52S, Long. 16S.32E [S.E. of Fiji]. Spoke her with flags - all well.

Pall Mall Gazette, 25/04/1887:
The Aberdeen Line - passage to Australia. The favourite clipper ship ARISTIDES will be despatched from E. India Docks, London, 5 May, taking saloon passengers to Melbourne and at through rates to other Australian ports. A surgeon will be carried. Particulars from owners, George Thompson & Co., 24 Leadenhall St., EC.

Liverpool Mercury, 25/03/1890:
Dover - ARISTIDES, ship, from Sydney for London, in tow of ANGLIA, tug.

Sydney Morning Herald, 4/8/1890:
One of George Thompson's splendid Aberdeen white star ships, the ARISTIDES, arrived Sydney from London in capital order after voyage of 87 days from start point (Devon) or 89 days from London docks. Commander, as on previous voyages, was Capt. T. F. Spurling, who reports an uneventful voyage and general good health among the 8 passengers.

Sydney Mail, 22/8/1891:
Capt. Allen, who has succeeded Capt. Spurling, reports having left East India docks 14 May and start point 18 May. Passage from London to equator was 31 days, 23 days from equator to the Cape and 17 days from Cape to Meridian of Cape Leuwin 17 days (71 days so far), followed by 20 days of easterly winds, calms and light airs before reaching Sydney. 20 days on the Australian coast is too long for a ship like the ARISTIDES, but in the absence of a screen, even one of George Thompson's Aberdeen built white star flyers cannot defy a head wind or laugh at a calm.

Newcastle Morning Herald, 14/10/1893:

Sydney Mail, 4/11/1903:
Reason to fear ARISTIDES, Capt. W. T. Poppy, has been lost at sea with all hands. She left Caleto Beuno 26 May for San Francisco and has not been heard of. After landing general cargo at Sydney last year, she took coal from Newcastle to Puerto Bueno and left there with nitrates for San Francisco. Capt. Poppy spent the principal part of his life on the Aberdeen line clippers. In ARISTIDES he gallantly rescued crew of French barque TERRE NEUVE, which was met in a sinking condition in the southern ocean and landed the shipwrecked crew at Sydney. Capt. Poppy has a wife and family in England. The chief officer, Mr Le Fairre, was previous to joining ARISTIDES for the present voyage, for many years in the Union Steamship Co. and has a wife and family residing at Balmain.

Newcastle Morning Herald, 4/1/1904:
Report from San Francisco - loss of cargo of nitrates carried by missing British ship ARISTIDES has been paid by underwriters. She sailed from Caleta Bueno, Chile, for San Francisco soon after the great hurricane raged on the Chilean coast and has not since been heard from. She was one of the fastest sailing ships afloat."

Her Aberdeen build cannot easily be disguised, but wear and tear incidental to 23 years of close and constant work has not been without effect on her appearance. Sailed from Frederick Stadt 10 March and arrived Adelaide 30 June. Left Adelaide 2 July for Melbourne. Moderate winds to Cape Otway, the strong W & NW winds until arrival at the heads, where detained by strong northerly winds.

Then the wind shifted suddenly to WSW and to W and blew squalls driving her almost half way over to New Zealand. Terrific westerly squalls, heavy thunder and lightning and high seas made it impossible to head up for port.

Wrecked Tamar Heads, Tasmania, 8 June 1883:
By now reduced to a barque, the ASTEROPE, under Master Stapleton left Gravesend, London for Launceston, Tasmania on 13 December 1882 but when off the Lizard collided with an unknown vessel and lost her rudder.  She was towed to Plymouth for repairs then set out again on 31 January 1883.  

However, rough weather forced her to return again leaking badly.  Sailing yet again on 28 February she finally made it to Tasmania only to run onto Hebe Reef, Tamar Heads on 8 June all were saved.  

Efforts to tow her off using the steamers TAMAR, AVON and EMPRESS OF INDIA failed and she was abandoned with three and a half feet of water in the hold. A number of small vessels managed to recover some of the cargo, valued at 15, 000 pounds Stg., and the wreck was sold at auction. After about a third of the cargo was recovered, the vessel broke up in a gale on the 15th. of June.
 
The inquiry held at Launceston found the master had been negligent in his navigation of the entrance to the Tamar River, and the Police Magistrate, who was presiding, considered his certificate should be suspended for three months. The Nautical Assessor, however, considered only a censure was required, and under the Inquiry Into Wrecks Act 1874 (38 Victoria, No. 2), section 16, his certificate was returned.

Wreck of ASTEROPE on Tamar Heads, 15/6/1883. Capt. Stapleton was steering a S.E. course and watching to get the leading light towers in a proper line for entering the heads, unaware that he was a little too far eastward and that his course would bring him over the Hebe Reef, which was then covered, it being high water. Vessel struck the reef only about 20ft. from only portion that bears at low water and appears to have entered a sort of gut way amongst the projecting rocks, where she struck hard and fast. and was soon jammed immovably by falling tide. During that night wind and sea increased and ship bumped, rolled and strained so heavily that the men were unable to go aloft and afraid to remain on deck for falling masts and spars. Next morning it was decided to abandon ship. Ships boats had to be moored off and crew dropped into them one by one when they saw an opportunity. Only small part of effect of crew were saved. Captain, who was last to leave, unable to save his clothes and charts.

Morning Chronicle, 15/04/1857:
Thames Police Court - 3 Irish labourers had been employed trimming ballast all day on board ship AUSTRAL.  In the evening they were seen drunk and staggering making their way to the dock entrance.  On being searched one was found in possession of about a dozen brass rods, which were found to have been wrenched from the cabin door of the AUSTRAL.  The Steward of the AUSTRAL found that 9 bottles of champagne were missing from the store room.  Admission had been obtained from the hold by breaking through the bulkhead, which was very thick.  Pieces of the champagne bottles were found among the ballast on which they had been working.  They pleaded not guilty and were committed for trial.

Aberdeen Journal, 02/12/1857 (quoting Geelong Advertiser):
One of the handsomest models that ever entered our inner harbour.  From London to the Heads [Melbourne] the voyage was performed in 84 days, only one day more than was taken by the famous MARCO POLO on her last voyage.  Captain Martin is well known and highly esteemed in Geelong.  A letter from a passenger reads ""The kindness and attention I have received from Captain and Mrs. Martin cannot be described... we had not only every comfort, but every luxury"".

South Australian Advertiser, 15/08/1861:
Port Adelaide Police Court, James Craig, Cook of the Ship AUSTRAL, was charged with refusal of duty on Wednesday morning.  When called up in the morning he was in liquor and commenced quarrelling with the Steward and at half past eight the breakfast not being ready for the men. The Captain spoke to him about neglecting his duty, when he was insolent and refused to do any more work aboard. Committed for one month.

South Australian Advertiser, 05/10/1861:
Port Augusta (S. Australia) Police Court - William Johnson, Samuel Letce, John de Mount, Henry Cressy, James P. Erson, James Turner and John Brown, seven of the crew of the ship AUSTRAL, were charged by Capt. Robert Phillips with refusal of duty in the morning of this day. They endeavoured to prove they were worked too much and short rationed... the stipendiary magistrate asked them if they were willing to go aboard to their duty, but they positively refused. The court sentenced them all to 3 months imprisonment in Redruth Gaol, with hard labour. Upon their application through the court the Captain allowed them their clothes.

AUSTRALIAN, lost on homeward passage which left Sydney 5 Sept, 1868, was one of the finest ships that ever floated on the waters of Port Jackson.

In SW gale force 8 red light of another vessel seen - inexplicably (but only 3 crew on deck) AVALANCHE did not give way.  Other vessel, the FOREST, in attempting to avoid collision, struck AVALANCHE on port side, causing her to sink within 5 mins.  3 on deck (only survivors) jumped onto FOREST'S forecastle.  FOREST was abandoned within 15 mins and crew took to open sea in boats of which only one survived to reach Chesie Beach where they were assisted ashore in a gallant rescue.

Belfast Newsletter, 21/05/1877:
News received from New Zealand of loss of Australian clipper chip OCEAN MAIL. Vessel cleared from Wellington for London March 10 and was ready for sea at same time as Messrs Shaw, Saville & Co.'s clipper ship AVALANCHE. Both vessels had similar cargoes, were each of the very highest class and only differed slightly in age.  They were therefore considered very fairly matched and great interest was felt in the contemplated race home. The crews are said to have betted considerably on the result.  But OCEAN MAIL had only been out three days when she ran ashore and became total wreck (all saved).

Birmingham Daily Post, 13/09/1877:
AVALANCHE carried 26 saloon, 17 second cabin and 20 third class passengers. She carried no emigrants, pasengers bring mostly colonists. After colliding with the FOREST she was nearly cut in two and sank within three minutes, before there was time to launch the boats. Only survivors of AVALANCHE were 3rd Officer, J. C. Sherrington, and 2 seamean, Mills and McCarthy. They were in only surviving boat of the FOREST, which was pluckily rescued by two Portland fishing boats, which battled with the waves for a considerable time before reaching it.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 25/09/1877:
Cunard company contemplate improved type of ship with several water-tight bulkheads to a deck 5 or 6 feet above waterline. The AVALANCHE, though a fine vessel, was sunk in a few minutes through the absence of this prime necessity.

Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper, 14/10/1877:
Report of official enquiry into loss of AVALANCHE and FOREST - the commissioner, after reviewing the evidence, said it was clear the AVALANCHE, being on the port tack, must have known when they saw the red light of the FOREST that she was on the starboard tack and consequently it was her duty to give way. She had the option of either going ahead or astern as she saw fit. She elected to go astern, was undoubtedly primarily responsible for collision, at the same time. Without suspending or cancelling certificate of Capt. Lockhart of the FOREST, they thought he ought to be reprimanded for not keeping his eye on the green light of the AVALANCHE and not acting with greater promtitude at the moment of collision.

The Graphic, 15/12/1877:
In contemplation to build in Portland a small church as memorial to Capt. Williams, passengers and crew of ill-fated ship AVALANCHE - to give sacred character to resting place of those who lie beneath the waves opposite proposed church. The captain of the AVALANCHE was very popular and much respected in New Zealand, whither he had made several voyages. Numbers of those who have been passengers with him will no doubt gladly help to raise it in his memory as a recognition of the courtesy and kindness they have received from him."

11 October 1882 - stranded on Leversay Island, South Uist, while on maiden voyage from Aberdeen to Cardiff and became a total loss.

The Times, 12 October 1882:
'Disaster At Sea. A telegram was received in Aberdeen yesterday afternoon, stating that the splendid steamer Balgairn, the largest vessel ever built in Aberdeen, bad been Wrecked on her maiden voyage. The Balgairn had a carrying capacity of 4,000 tons, was 325ft. in length, with 40ft. breadth of beam. Her engines had a maximum horse power of 2,000. The vessel belonged to Messrs. Davidson of Aberdeen, and was built by Messrs. Hall, Russell, and Co. She was launched on the 15th of August with great state in the presence of a vast assemblage, and was christened by the Countess of Aberdeen, a banquet being afterwards held, at which the Earl of Aberdeen presided. After receiving her fittings, the vessel was thrown open to the public and thousands visited her, the money drawn being given to local charities. On Monday last she left on her first trip, the intention being to go to Cardiff, take on a cargo, and proceed to Point De Galle. A distinguished company, including several of the shareholders, accompanied the vessel on her trial trip. She proceeded by the north passage between Skye on the east, and the South Uist on the west. At a point on Leversay Island, in the Sound of Benbecula, the vessel went ashore this morning, and immediately filled with water. There was little hope from the first of getting her off, but telegrams were dispatched to Glasgow for assistance. The captain, in a telegram to the owners, states that the vessel is likely to become a total wreck. All on board, including a crew of 40 men, were saved. The steamer bad a year's stores on board, and the loss is estimated at £60,000. The Balgairn was commanded by Captain Crombie. The intelligence created the greatest excitement and disappointment in Aberdeen. DISASTER AT SEA .'

""BALGAIRN"" (S.S.) 

The Merchant Shipping Acts, 1854 to 1876. 

IN the matter of the formal Investigation held at Aberdeen, on the 15th and 16th of November 1882, before H. C. ROTHERY, Esquire, Wreck Commissioner, assisted by Captain METHVEN and Captain VAUX, as Assessors, into the circumstances attending the stranding and loss of the steamship ""BALGAIRN,"" of Aberdeen, near Grey Island, South Uist, on the 11th of October 1882. 

Report of Court. 

The Court, having carefully inquired into the circumstances of the above-mentioned shipping casualty, finds, for the reasons annexed, that the stranding and loss of the said ship was due to the negligent navigation thereof by William Allan Crombie, the master, in having, when he was approaching Ushinish Light, and although that light was not visible, gone below without having given any orders to reduce the speed of the vessel, and without having taken any steps to ascertain his true position either by a cast of the lead or otherwise, and in having remained below playing cards when the safety of the vessel and of the lives of those on board imperatively demanded his presence on deck. 

For these wrongful acts and defaults the Court suspends the certificate of the said William Allan Crombie for twelve months, but recommends that during the period of such suspension he be allowed a first mate's certificate. 

The Court is not asked to make any order as to costs. 

Dated this 16th day of November 1882.

Annex to the Report. 

This case was heard at Aberdeen on the 15th and 16th of November 1882, when Mr. Duncan appeared for the Board of Trade, Mr. Prosser for the owners and for the first and second officers of the ""Balgairn,"" and Mr. Sutherland for the master. Fourteen witnesses having been produced by the Board of Trade and examined, Mr. Duncan handed in a statement of the questions upon which the Board of Trade desired the opinion of the Court. Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Prosser then addressed the Court on behalf of their respective parties, and Mr. Duncan having been heard in reply, the Court proceeded to give judgment on the questions on which its opinion had been asked. The circumstances of the case are as follow: 

The ""Balgairn"" was an iron screw steamship belonging to the Port of Aberdeen, of 2,577 tons gross and 1,661 tons net register, and was fitted with engines of 380 horse power. She was built in Aberdeen in the present year, and was the property of Messrs. James and Alexander Davidson, of Aberdeen, shipowners, and others, Messrs. Davidson being the managing owners. She was a first-class vessel, built at a cost of 45,500l., and furnished with all the newest appliances. She had five boats, all apparently very good. She was fitted with steam steering gear, and could be steered from both the upper and the lower bridge amidships as well as from aft. She had five compasses, a standard compass fixed on a tripod on the upper bridge, a steering compass also on the upper bridge, another in the wheelhouse amidships, and a third before the wheel aft, and a tell-tale compass in the chart room. She had a large supply of charts, and was in every respect thoroughly and efficiently equipped for a voyage to almost any part of the world, and was classed 100 Al at Lloyd's. Thus equipped she left Aberdeen, on the 9th of October last, for Cardiff in ballast, having on board a crew of thirty-eight hands all told, five guest passengers more or less connected with the vessel, and six engineer mechanics to assist in case anything should go wrong with the machinery. The owner suggested that, as she was a new vessel, it might be better to go round by the southern route, so as to have a port to put into in case of accident, but the master preferred to go the shorter and northern route, and he was accordingly allowed to do so. They proceeded on their voyage, the vessel making about nine knots an hour, without anything occurring, except that the bearings, as is usual with new vessels, became heated, making it necessary to ease the engines occasionally to cool them, until about 8 p.m. of the 10th, when they were off Stornoway. At that hour the chief officer came on deck, and was told by the master to keep a look out for Glas Island Lighthouse, and when he was within a mile of it to alter the course to S.W. At 9.15 p.m. Glas Island Lighthouse came in view, upon which the mate, on his own authority, altered the vessel's course so as to bring the light a little on the starboard bow; and at about 10 o'clock, thinking that he was then about a mile from the light, he, in accordance with the master's directions, altered the course to S.W., and at the same time informed the captain that he had done so. The captain shortly afterwards came on to the bridge, and seeing that the mate had miscalculated his distance from the lighthouse, and that instead of being only a mile from it, they were between three and four miles off, he altered the course to W. by S. directly for the light, and kept her on that course for about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; when, believing that he was then about a mile from it, he altered the course to S.W. 1/2 W. by the standard compass, which he told us was the magnetic course, there being no deviation on the standard compass on that course, and he directed the mate to keep that course until further orders. At midnight the chief officer was relieved by the second mate, who had orders from him to keep her on the same course, and to look out for the Ushinish Light, and as soon as he saw it to call the captain. By about 1 a.m. the weather had become very threatening, the wind blowing strong from the S.W., with heavy passing showers, and no light having been seen the second mate became anxious, and accordingly sent to the captain, who was then in the cabin, to ask him to come up on deck. On his doing so some conversation seems to have taken place between them as to what ought to be done, no light being visible, and also as to whether the speed of the vessel should be reduced, the telegraph at the time standing at full speed. The master, however, thought that it was not necessary to reduce the speed, as the vessel, we are told, was not making so much way as she had been doing owing to the strong head wind and sea, but he ordered the course of the vessel to be altered a point to the southward, to S.W. 1/2 S., and then left the deck and returned to the cabin. The second mate accordingly kept the vessel on that course until about five minutes before 2, when, observing a dark object a little on the port bow, he asked the man at the helm, who was standing by him, what it was, but he had hardly got the words out of his mouth before the ship struck. On feeling the vessel strike the captain at once rushed on deck and telegraphed to the engine room to put the engines full speed astern; but on Captain Davidson, the ship's husband, who was a passenger on board, suggesting that, if she came off, there might be a danger of her sinking in deep water, the engines were stopped. They were, however, soon afterwards again put on full speed astern, but they were not able to move her, and the vessel remained aground where she had struck, namely, on a rock inside of and some 3 or 4 miles north of Ushinish Lighthouse. At daylight all hands were landed on a little island, called Grey Island, whence they were safely conveyed to the shore, but the vessel herself became a total wreck. 

These are the circumstances under which this lamentable casualty took place, and the first question which we are asked is, ""What was the cause of the stranding of the vessel?"" The stranding of the vessel was no doubt due to her having been allowed to get too far to the westward of her proper course; how it was that she got so far out of her course will better appear when we come to answer some of the other questions. 

The second question which we are asked is, ""Whether at the time when she left Aberdeen, her compasses were in good and proper order, and were properly adjusted?"" We were told by Mr. Berry, a gentleman residing in Aberdeen, and who has had a large experience in the adjustment of ship's compasses, that he adjusted the ""Balgairn's"" compasses, and prepared the deviation cards for all the five compasses on the 28th of September last, where she then lay in the harbour. He told us that in doing so he had the assistance of Captain Davidson, the ship's husband, and of two young men from his own office, and that it was done most carefully, the circumstances being exceptionally favourable for the purpose, there not being at the time any iron ships in the harbour; and he told us that, at the request of Captain Davidson, the vessel was swung twice for the purpose of checking the deviations. We have therefore no reason to think that the compasses were not properly adjusted when she left Aberdeen, or that they were not in good and proper order; at all events, the usual and proper measures seem to have been taken to make them so. 

The third question which we are asked is, ""Whether proper measures were subsequently taken to verify them, and to ascertain that they were in proper working order?"" It should be observed that although the compasses may have been in good and proper order, and the deviation cards quite correct, when the vessel left Aberdeen, it did not follow that they would continue so after she had started, the compasses of new iron ships being very liable to go wrong within a few hours of their sailing; a fact which seems to have been well known to the master, for it is on this that he seems to rest his justification. But if it was so, it was all the more necessary that he should watch his compasses carefully, and ascertain at every possible opportunity whether they continued in good order, and whether the deviations were correctly indicated on the cards. And how do we find that this master discharged that duty? So far as we see, beyond taking one observation at about half past 3 o'clock on the afternoon of the 10th, he did nothing. He seems to have found that all his other compasses had gone wrong, but he thought that the standard compass, although half a point out on one course, was right on a S.W. course. He told us that he had intended to verify the compasses again as they passed the Eye peninsula, when the ship would be nearly on the same course on which she would be when going through the Little Minch; owing, however, to his not being able to get the assistance of any of his officers he failed to do so, and continued his course without taking those steps which in the opinion of the assessors he should have done to satisfy himself that his compasses were in proper order. 

The fourth question which we are asked is, ""Whether proper measures were taken to ascertain and verify the position of the vessel when off Glas Island, and whether his distance from that point was correctly estimated?"" It seems clear that when the chief officer first altered the course of the vessel to S.W., thinking that he was then about a mile from the light, he greatly underestimated his distance from it; but there appears to be no reason to think that the master made any such mistake, or that when, after standing in some two miles nearer to the light he finally put the vessel on a S.W. 1/2 W. course, she was not then within about a mile of the light. 

The fifth question which we are asked is, ""What charts were on board? At whose cost were they provided? and whether they were sufficient for the safe navigation of the ship?"" A list of the charts which the vessel had on board has been brought in, and shews that she had a very full and complete set to take her to almost any part of the world. They were, we are told, provided by the owners, and were certainly amply sufficient for the navigation of the ship on the voyage on which she was bound. 

The sixth question which we are asked is, ""Whether safe and proper courses were set and steered after passing Glas Island Light, and whether due and proper allowance was made for tides and currents?"" The course, as we have seen, which was set from about a 1/4 after 10 p.m. when they were off Glas Island Lighthouse to 1 a.m., was S.W. 1/2 W., and from 1 a.m. until they struck S.W. 1/2 S. Now these courses, if made good, would, there can be no doubt, have taken the vessel on a safe course down the channel some five miles or so to the eastward of Ushinish Lighthouse; and the question is, how it was that she got some 7 miles to the westward of that course, and inside of Ushinish Lighthouse, when she struck. The master has told us, and his statement is confirmed by the sailing directions for the west coast of Scotland that the flood tide at this part sets to the N.E., and the ebb tide in the opposite direction, or nearly up and down the channel. He also told us that from Glas Island Lighthouse they had an hour and a half flood and an hour and a half ebb, which he supposed would about counteract one another; but whether they would or not, the tide being nearly up and down the channel would not account for her having got some seven miles to the westward of her course. We are also not disposed to think that the courses which the master and officers said that they had steered were not the courses steered by them as indicated by the standard compass. But if the standard compass had gone wrong, and instead of being, as they supposed it to be, magnetic, it had a deviation of a point to the west, that would be quite sufficient in a run of 35 miles, which is the distance between Glas Island Lighthouse and the place where she grounded, to account for her having got some 7 miles to the westward of her course. In our opinion the only way of accounting for this casualty is by supposing that the standard compass, by which the course was steered, and which was supposed to be magnetic, had gone wrong, so that when they were steering S.W. 1/2 W. and S.W. 1/2 S. by it, they were in fact steering about a point more to the westward. 

The seventh question which we are asked is, ""Whether proper measures were taken to ascertain and verify the position of the vessel at midnight and about 1 a.m. on the 11th of October; and whether a safe and proper alteration was made about 1 a.m. in the course; and whether due and proper allowance was then made for tides and currents?"" It appears to us that from the time of passing Glas Island Light no steps whatever were taken to ascertain and verify the position of the vessel, and certainly none were taken either at midnight or at 1 a.m., although Ushinish Light had not been seen, and the master must have known that the safety of the vessel depended on his passing outside of that light. As regards the alteration of the course one point to the southward, which was made at 1 a.m., it was an alteration in the right direction, and the only mistake seems to have been that it was not altered more in that direction. 

The eighth question which we are asked is, ""Whether the log book was properly kept?"" It was suggested by the learned advocate for the Board of Trade that the appearance of the log book seemed to show that the entries therein could not be implicitly relied on, and that the slate on which the entries were first made should have been kept and produced. But we do not think that there is anything in the appearance of the log book to impeach the accuracy of the entries therein; it seems to have been made up at about 8 o'clock on the night in question; and only the entries subsequent to that hour were made after they got on shore. The slate, too, is only used for writing down rough notes of the entries to be made in the log book; and when these entries have been made the rough notes on the slate are generally rubbed out; the fact, therefore, that they were not preserved is in our opinion no ground for not believing in the accuracy of the entries in the log book. 

The ninth question which we are asked is, ""Whether the master was on deck at the time when the safety of the vessel required his personal supervision?"" The master, who had elected to take the northern course somewhat against the owners wishes, was bound in consequence to have exercised the greatest care in the navigation of his vessel. Let us see how he discharged that duty. It seems that the only orders given by the master to the chief officer were, that he was to alter the vessel's course to the S.W. when they were within a mile of Glas Island Lighthouse. The mate accordingly, who had it seems never before passed through this channel, being deceived by the brightness of the light, altered the course when they were yet some three or four miles from it; and it was only the accident of the master coming up on deck shortly afterwards that caused the mistake to be discovered. Thereupon we are told that she was steered directly for the light, and was kept on that course for about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, after which she was laid upon a S.W. 1/2 W. course; and we have the evidence of the master that, had that alteration not been made, the vessel would in all probability have gone on the Skeir-i-noc Rock. Now it was well known to the master that perhaps the most dangerous part of the navigation was, when approaching the Glas Island Lighthouse, between which and the Skeir-i-noc Rock the channel is only about 2 1/2 miles wide. A slight alteration of the helm, a little carelessness in the steering, a slight error in the compass, an error in estimating the distance from the light, would be quite sufficient to put the vessel upon the rock; and yet all the orders that the master gives to the mate when he leaves the bridge is to alter the course to S.W. when he thinks that he is within a mile of the light, an order which nearly resulted in putting her on the Skeir-i-noc Rock. Seeing the narrowness of the channel between the Glas Island Lighthouse and the Skier-i-noc Rock, and the dangerous nature of the navigation, it was of the utmost importance that the master should have been on deck from the time the Glas Island Light came in view until they had passed it and she had been put upon a safe course; and it was a grave neglect of duty on his part to be below at the time, and to leave the navigation of the vessel to an officer who had never been there before, and who was ignorant of its dangers, and not to come up on deck until, according to his own statement, the vessel was heading directly for the Skeir-i-noc Rock. 

Whether the master was on deck or not after passing the Glas Island Lighthouse, and when, it is not easy to say; the chief officer told us that he did not see him after that time, nor did the second officer when he came on deck at midnight to take charge; and, according to the master, he was down in the cabin playing at cards from about midnight until a little before 2 when the vessel struck, except for a short time at about 1 a.m., when the second mate sent for him. During all this time, namely, from midnight to the time when the vessel struck, the wind and sea was, we are told, increasing, and Ushinish Light, to the eastward of which it was essential to the safety of the ship that they should pass, had not been seen. Now it will be seen from the sailing directions, as well as from the Admiralty charts, that the Ushinish Light is only visible from seaward between the bearings N.N.E. going round by east to S.W. 1/2 S.; so that to a vessel approaching from the northward the light would not be visible if she had got so near to the shore as to be to the westward of a N.N.E. bearing from it. The fact, therefore, that the light was not visible may have been, and in this case no doubt was, due to the vessel having got to the westward of that bearing, whence the light could not be seen. This being so, it was of the utmost importance that the master, who alone of all his officers appears to have been acquainted with the navigation of these waters, should have been on deck, if not from midnight, at all events from 1 a.m., when he must have known that the light, if he was in his proper course, should have been visible. Here, then, are two occasions when the safety of the vessel required his personal supervision first, when he was nearing the narrow channel between the Glas Island Lighthouse and the Skeir-i-noc Rock; and, secondly, when he was summoned by the second mate to come on deck, and was informed that the Ushinish Light could not be seen, and that the weather had become worse. 

The tenth question which we are asked is, ""Whether the total neglect of the lead was justifiable?"" in our opinion there was no justification whatever for this neglect of the lead. It seems that she had a patent lead on board, by which he could have ascertained the depth of water by slightly easing the speed of the vessel, but he never used it. In the sailing directions for the west coast of Scotland, Part I., page 146, it is said that ""in navigating this part of the coast in foggy "" weather"" (and the same observation applies to weather when it is so dark and stormy that lights cannot be seen) ""vessels should keep outside the 50 fathom "" line, which in general will give an offing of half a "" mile from the points."" The line of soundings here referred to will be seen clearly laid down on the charts, and looking at the course which this vessel must have taken, it is clear that, for at least an hour or more before she struck, the vessel must have been within the fifty fathom line; so that if a cast of the lead had been taken at any time after 1 o'clock, when he was called up by the second mate, he would have seen that he was out of his course, and in imminent danger of going ashore. He talks with the second mate about the speed of the vessel, and although he has not seen the Ushinish Light, and is quite ignorant of his position, he keeps the telegraph pointing at ""Full speed ahead;"" and having merely altered the vessel's course one point to the southward, he returns to the cabin and continues his game at ""Nap."" If ever there was a case in which the neglect of the lead was utterly unjustifiable it is this. 

The eleventh question which we are asked is, ""Whether the vessel was navigated with proper and seamanlike care."" It is obvious she was not. Let us see what the facts of the case are. The master leaves Aberdeen with a new and admirably equipped vessel, worth, we are told, some five and forty thousand pounds, and elects to take the northern and more dangerous route, on which he will have to pass through some very narrow channels. He knew, as he has admitted, that the compasses of new vessels are very liable to go wrong soon after leaving harbour; and yet he takes little trouble to verify them, or to see that his deviation cards are correct. Again, when nearing Glas Island Light, between which and the Skeir-i-noc Rock there is a very narrow channel through which they would have to pass, he leaves the deck in charge of an officer who had never before been that route, giving him the loosest instructions for his guidance; and he only comes on deck after the vessel's head had been put directly for the rock, and, according to his own account, just in time to save her from going on to it. Having passed the light and put the vessel on her course, he then goes below, and so far as appears does not come up again until he is sent for by the officer in charge of the deck, and told by him that the weather had become very threatening, and that the Ushinish Light, which should have been seen by that time, is not visible. He remains on deck for about a quarter of an hour, and not seeing the light, he alters the course of the vessel one point more to the south, and then, without knowing at all where the vessel was, without taking any cast of the lead, and without reducing the speed of the vessel, and leaving the telegraph to the engine-room pointing to ""full speed ahead,"" he returns to the cabin and resumes the game of cards which had been interrupted when he was called on deck, and he continues playing until the vessel strikes. A grosser case of neglect has seldom come before the Court; he has neglected almost every precaution which it is incumbent on a master to take when navigating a vessel in dangerous waters and on a dark and stormy night. 

Under these circumstances we are asked, ""Whether the master and officers are, or any of them is, in default?"" And it is added that ""in the opinion of the Board of Trade the certificates of the master, first mate, and second mate should be dealt with."" So far as the first and second mates are concerned, we think that no blame attaches to them, for they only carried out the master's orders, and appear to have done their duty throughout. The whole blame for this unhappy casualty rests with the master, and with the master only. According to the master's own admission he was in the cabin playing at cards from midnight until the vessel struck, except for a short time at about 1 a.m., when he was called on deck by the second mate, who at any rate seems to have been alive to the danger in which the vessel then was. It is not pretended that the master was at the time fatigued with his previous watches, so that it was necessary for him to go and get some rest. Nothing of the kind; he was playing in the cabin at Nap when the safety of the vessel and the lives of those on board imperatively demanded his presence on deck, and we feel that we should not be doing our duty unless we marked our sense of his misconduct by a very severe punishment. He has lost a valuable vessel which was entrusted to his care, and for which he can make no compensation whatever to the owners; he has risked the lives of some 50 people by his neglect; and we think that we shall be passing a very lenient sentence upon him if we suspend his master's certificate for 12 months. At the same time we shall, as we have been requested to do so by his advocate, recommend that during the suspension of his master's certificate, he be allowed a first mate's certificate. 

The Court will make no order as to costs.

BALLANTYNE was originally built in Norway by Sarpsborg Mek. Verksted A.S. K.S. (Yard number 54) as one of Ubstein popular design U.T. 704 in 1983 for unknown owners but was never completed. 

She lay rusting away in Norway until 1991when she was towed to Aberdeen shipbuilders, Hall Russell's, for Ballravie Shipping, Aberdeen whose MD was also MD for the Aberdeen shipbuilders and was to be named BALLANTYNE.  BALLANTYNE was pulled into the covered in building berth with strong winches and jacked up and wooden blocks were placed under the ship for propellers and underwater work to be installed by the workforce, who nicknamed the project 'the rusy hulk'.  It took the workforce in Aberdeen shipbuilder Hall Russell a huge task to pull 1,000 tons of steel up a concrete incline and jack the ship up to about 3'0 or more on a sloping base.

Unfortunately Ballravie Shipping were declared bankrupt and the project was again unfinished.  the ship was put back into the water and towed to Husumer Schiffswerft Inn Gebr Kroeger Germany (Yard number 1510) and finally emerged as LANCELOT ROVER in 1993.  

She was named TORBAS for Kingbas Ltd (Remoy Management A/S Hamilton Bermuda (British) until 1998 when she became HAVILLA CHARMER for Havilla Supply Ships Aalesund, Norway as a standby safety boat until 2003.

Aberdeen Press & Journal, Thursday 15 November 1962:
'The BALLYRORY, a self-trimming motor collier and the last vessel on the order books of Hall, Russell & Co. Ltd., Aberdeen, was launched yesterday afternoon.
With the launching of this vessel Aberdeen's shipyards are almost denuded of construction work, as John Lewis & Sons Ltd., have only two small trawlers on their books, one of which is already well in hand.
Hall, Russell and Company have still a good list of fitting out work, but apart from the two trawlers Lewis are already having to depend on repair work, and the immediate outlook for new contracts is bleak.
Although Hall, Russell & Co. have no other....it was stated yesterday that there would be no immediate big pay-off.
The BALLYRORY, named by Mrs J S Kennedy, wife of the managing director of the owning company, is the second of the identical vessels built to the order of John Kelly Ltd., Belfast.
Designed as a self-trimming collier and as a general cargo carrier for coastwise trading between the North of Ireland, British ports and on the short international runs, the BALLYRORYwill eventually follow into service the BALLYRUSH, which completed loaded trials on the Clyde last week.
The BALLYRORY will have a total deadweight capacity of about 2000 tons and the machinery will be arranged aft.  There are three cargo holds.
The BALLYRORY makes a towering background for the picture of the platform party before the launching.'

Aberdeen Journal, 01/12/1875:
Letter read to Aberdeen Harbour Board from A. Hall & Co. - the owners of the new ship BAY OF NAPLES have strongly remonstrated against your account for shore and harbour dues - principal complaint excessive charge of 2 shillings per ton harbour dues for a vessel going round Cape of Good Hope. No shipowner will come to Aberdeen for a new ship if he is aware he will be thus charged for a new ship should he send her direct to the East.

Liverpool Mercury, 30/09/1879:
Shipowners are approaching a climax in producing fast sailing ships. The ship BAY OF NAPLES, commander Captain Bremner, recently accomplished a voyage from Liverpool to the rice ports and home in 6 months and a few days, which by practical judges is considered to be one of the fastest voyages. Great credit is due to the captain for the rapid voyage and good condition of ship on return.

Bristol Mercury, 29/10/1883:
Capt. E. Tidmarsh of ship BAY OF NAPLES reports on arrival Singapore Sept. 18th 96 days from Penarth. On arrival Baada [Java] Aug. 21st ashes were teeming in torrents from volcano. On getting to the Straits came through a bank of ashes and could only force the ship half a mile an hour. When I got into clearn water was all day sailing through dead bodies. I stood off for the Banca Straits and vessel got on the Melville Bank (soft mud) - some plates broken. On second day I hove about 10 or 12 tons of coal overboard and, a fair wind coming on, set the topsail and jibs and hove the ship into 4 fathoms of water. English Man of War Champion declined my request for a tow, signalling he could not delay.

Steel boiler and triple-expansion engines are being supplied and fitted by the builders. On leaving the ways she was named Ben Ardna.

Aberdeen Daily Journal, Wednesday 22.01.1913
DERELICT DANISH BARQUE
CREW RESCUED BY ABERDEEN TRAWLER
Another instance of the heroism displayed by Aberdeen trawl fishermen was reported at Aberdeen yesterday. On arrival at the Fish Market of the local trawler Ben Ardna (Captain Christian Pedersen) ten out of the crew of eleven of the barque Willi, of Marstal, Denmark, stepped ashore, and proceeded to the Sailor's Home, Mearns Street.

-------------------------

WHAT’S IN A NAME? The three BEN ARDNAs.
Does anyone know if there is a hill called Ben Ardna?

The first BEN ARDNA was a steam trawler, launched by Hall, Russell & Co. Ltd. at Aberdeen on the 9th December 1912. She was built at a cost of £5,950 for one of Aberdeen’s leading trawlowning firms, Richard Irvin and Sons Ltd. of Albert Quay, and was registered in Aberdeen with the number A 517 on Boxing Day 1912.
She did not have a long career in fishing, as in August 1914, along with another twenty-seven of Richard Irvin’s fleet, she was requisitioned by the Admiralty and put to work as a minesweeper with the Dover Patrol.
As with her fishing career, her naval career was also short lived. On the 8th August 1915, off the Elbow Buoy at the mouth of the River Tay, she suffered the fate of many other trawlers engaged in minesweeping, and detonated a mine which had been laid by the German submarine UC.1.
She sank with the loss of two of her Royal Naval Reserve crew: -
William Harwood Brown, a Second Hand aged 35, the son of Mrs Mary Duck of Scarborough.
and 
Henry Herbert Morris, a Deckhand and husband of Mrs Helen Taylor of Aberdeen.

The second and third BEN ARDNAs were both wartime “Strath” class trawlers. 
These standard trawlers were built in large numbers during WWI throughout the U.K. and by various shipyards, but all were based on a standard design for both the hull and machinery produced by Hall, Russell, who took the lead in their production.  At the end of the war, the Admiralty had no use for these large numbers of basic minesweepers and in the early 1920s they were sold off for commercial use as either trawlers or small cargo vessels.

In 1920, Richard Irvin bought two of these vessels to replace the company’s war losses, the WILLIAM BARLOW and the JOHN BRADFORD. These were exact sister ships, built by Hall, Russell and launched on the same day, the 15th July 1917, as Yard Nos 606 and 607. 
The Strath Class were all named after members of the crew of either H.M.S. Victory or Royal Sovereign at the Battle of Trafalgar, and both William Barlow and John Bradford were Privates in the Marines on H.M.S. Victory.

The William Barlow was first registered by the Admiralty at London, with the Official Number 144416, but when she was bought by Richard Irvin, they registered her in Aberdeen under the ownership of R. Irvin & Sons Ltd, North Shields. The Lloyds Register Supplement entry (78525) for 1920 lists her as being named the DORILEEN, ex BEN ARDNA, ex WILLIAM BARLOW. This vessel remained in the Irvin fleet until she was broken up in 1957.

The John Bradford was also registered by the Admiralty at London, with the Official Number 144415, and bought by Richard Irvin. Her entry in the Lloyds Register Supplement for 1920 (77709) records her being named BEN ARDNA, ex DORILEEN, ex JOHN BRADFORD. She to was registered at Aberdeen, with the fishing number A412 and remained in Irvin’s fleet until requisitioned as an examination vessel in WWII. She sank in 1942 after a collision on the Tyne, fortunately without loss of life.

Thus, both vessels were, according to Lloyds, named BEN ARDNA, but they changed names. Why, in the case of the DORILEEN, Irvin departed from their usual practice of naming all their ships with the prefix BEN, or who, what or where the name Dorileen came from, is not recorded and remains a mystery.

Completely wrecked near Amoy, China, 15 June 1856.

Aberdeen Journal, 17/05/1854:
'Launched last Saturday from yard of Messers A. Duthie & Co...Clipper built (of course)...property of G. Leslie for probably India or China trade...Commanded by Captain Budge, formerly of the Balmoral.'

Aberdeen Herald, 20/5/1854:
Messrs. A. Duthie & Co., turned out and excellent ship - clipper built of course - named the BEN AVON, of 684 tons, n.m., the property of Mr. G. Leslie, for probably the India or China trade, to be commanded by Capt. Budge, formerly of the Balmoral. The BEN AVON is a very beautiful model, will sail fast, and carry a large cargo. The launches passed off very successfully, and to the gratification of a great concourse of spectators.

Aberdeen Press and Journal, 3/9/1856:
Hong Kong, July 10 - The BEN AVON, Scott, from London for Shanghai, with a valuable cargo, was lost upon a rock off Hoetow point, 16th June. The vessel had previously been struck by lightning, which is supposed to have disarranged her compasses. She was going 13 knots at the time she struck. The master's wife, the owner's son, and three seamen, were unfortunately lost. The greater part of her cargo was washed ashore, and carried into the interior by the natives.

Freeman's Journal, 03/09/1856:
Regret to announce total loss by lightning and shipwreck of ship BEN AVON, bound from London for Shanghai, with distressing sacrifice of human life. She was owned by Leslie & Co., chartered by W.O. Young & Co., left London Docks 9 March with valuable cargo of merchandise. Wife of Commander, Capt. R. S. Scott & Mr. Leslie, son of owner (both passengers) were among those drowned. Capt. Scott reported her loss on 16 June as follows:- On 8 June we encountered dark and cloudy weather, with torrents of rain - about 1 o'clock there was a tremendous deal of thunder and ship fore and aft was struck by lightning. Every one on deck was struck down and whole vessel and rigging presented a vivid mass of fire.  On recovering themselves they examined the damage. It has stripped most of copper off rigging and mast, melted lead off rudder head and damaged compasses. We proceeded, using compass we thought least in error. On the 12th we got a very imperfect sight of the sun. We shaped a course accordingly, keeping the lead-log constantly going and from then till 16th, on night of which she was lost, no further observation could be made. In gale and heavy rain, ship at 8.30am was felt to graze as if she was passing over a shoal, but directly after she struck with great force, parting in two immediately and fell over with her deck to the sea, which broke furiously over it, sweeping everything from it. In less than 10 minutes the whole ship was broken up. The ship's company clung to the spars and rigging which were floating. In this way 23 of 28 succeeded in gaining the shore, but were all more or less wounded, cargo was thrown out onto different parts of coast, which was plundered immediately by the natives, who mustered in great numbers and beat off the men who attempted to retrieve it. The spot where the ship struck was on a point to the westward of Hentoo, 40 miles from Amoy [Chinese Coast opposite Taiwan].

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 21/1/1884:
Greatest anxiety was last night felt in seafaring circles in Aberdeen for safety of steamer BEN AVON, a telegram having been received from Scrabster that steam tug BENACHIE, which left Stornoway Saturday morning with disabled vessel in tow, has put into Scrabster, having cast off her charge due to severe gale & heavy sea. Nothing has since been heard of BEN AVON. BEN AVON's propeller was destroyed off Cape Wrath on 4 Jan. on voyage Liverpool-Aberdeen. Capt. Scrogie succeeded under canvas in reaching broad bay & was ultimately towed into Stornoway.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 26/1/1884:
BEN AVON has arrived in Orkney Islands in safety. Vessel left Stornoway Saturday morning in charge of steam tug BENACHIE to be towed to Aberdeen. All went well until Sunday morning when, because of severe gale & heavy sea, the vessels parted company. Telegram from Capt. Scorgie of BEN AVON stated he had arrived at Longhope, island of Walls, in tow of steam tug Granite City, BENACHIE being alongside. When steamer's tow rope broke in Thurso Bay, sea was so rough & night so dark that those on board the tug could not see the ship.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 2/2/1884:
Steamer BEN AVON, after a series of mishaps, arrived Aberdeen Tuesday in tow. They reached Aberdeen in 20 hours from Longhope. BEN AVON was taken alongside the ""Shears"" to have her propeller shaft lifted & will then be put on slip at A. Hall & Co.'s yard for repair."

""Death of Aberdeen Skipper.
Had Been a Trawlmaster for Thirty-Five Years.
One of the best known and most popular trawl masters sailing out of Aberdeen, Mr George Rose, has died at his residence, 38 Springbank Terrace, Aberdeen.  Mr Rose had been in indifferent health for about six months.
A native of Lowestoft, he came to the North of Scotland about forty-eight years ago, and for a number of years sailed out of Peterhead.  While in that port he carried out duties as master.
Coming to Aberdeen over thirty years ago, he joined the firm of Messrs John Lewis, Ltd., and had charge of vessels belonging to the firm.
After the war, Mr Rose took up duties as master with the Loch Line Steam Trawling and Fishing Co., Ltd., Aberdeen.  He had been a trawl master for thirty-five years.
Mr Rose, who was sixty-nine years of age, is survived by a grown-up family - a son who is also a trawl master, and three daughters.""

Glasgow Herald, 28/8/1873:
HMS LORD WARDEN, on passage Gibraltar-Cadiz, picked up the crew of 23 of British steamer BENACHIE, Capt. Fentie, of Aberdeen which foundered head first off Tarifa (near Cadiz). Vessel suddenly opened out forward & sank so rapidly the crew had only time to save their lives by taking to the boats, the compressed air causing an explosion in the after part as she went down. She had sprung a leak 6 hours before, but they were in hopes of overcoming it with the pumps so as to fetch her to Gibraltar, before reaching which the disaster occurred. BENACHIE was of 1150 tons burthen and had on board 1300 tons coal to Leghorn (Liverno). Crew being totally destitute of everything but what they stood in, officers & men of LORD WARDEN made a subscription for the shipwrecked seamen & they were treated with the greatest kindness & sent by the HELICAN to Gibraltar.

The Times November 25, 1873:
'We also have the report by the Court of Inquiry held as to the loss of the steamship Benachie, at Aberdeen, on the 6th inst. The Benachie left Newcastle on the 26th of July last, with a cargo of 1,150-tons of coal, exclusive of ""50 tons which she carried in her bunkers. All went well till 5a.m. of August 3, about 14 miles from Tarifa, in the Straits of Gibraltar, when the chief officer noticed she was much by the head. On sounding 5ft. 6in. of water was found in the forehold and 15in of water in the main ballast tanks. The pumps were set to work, but the water rapidly gained upon them, and about 10:30 the crew were ordered into the boats, which had been previously lowered in view of this emergency. Three minutes after being left, the ship went down by the head. The crew were picked up about three quarters of an hour afterwards by Her Majesty's ship Lord Warden. 'The wind at the time was from the S.E., with a slight chopping sea, but altogether moderate. In ascertaining the probable causes of the disaster, were found that they naturally limited themselves to three points for our investigation:-1. Had the Benachie received any previous injury 'by stranding or striking any floating object: The evidence is quite conclusive as to her never having received injury of any kind. 2. Whether she had been well and strongly built; whether her form was adapted for heavy cargoes; and whether the sluice valves, pumping arrangements, &c., were good and serviceable fitting. As to construction, &r., the evidence is most conclusive as to the care with which she was built and surveyed. With regard to the form of the Benachie, she was designed, and certainly adapted, for carrying large general cargoes with a good rate of speed, the entrance and run being line, with a very full body.  The floor was very flat, with a quick bilge, the radius being only five feet, a form, or opinion, ill adapted for heavy cargoes, such as iron ore. Mr, Wilson, the manager to Messrs. Hall, Russell, and Co., of Aberdeen, stated that the Benachie to have been adapted for the ore trade would have required additional strength. The master appears to have represented to one or other of the superintendents that if continued in the ore trade she would require to be strengthened an opinion which appears to have been arrived at from his noticing the vibration of the forecastle. 3. Whether she was overladen on this voyage, or whether she had been previously overladen to such an extent as to severely strain her frame and shake the rivets. Some of the witnesses stated that they had observed the boiler moving; others observed the forecastle head twisting; the master noticed much more vibration in the Benachie than in any other steamer. Mr. Hill, the then chief officer, often spoke of the straining of the ship, attributing it to the heavy cargo it was also stated that the ship was generally more uncomfortable in wet and heavy weather than other ships. The firemen in rough weather elected to remain in the engine-room rather than risk going to their berths in the forecastle. Captain 'Taylor, the superintendent, admitted having beard the crew, after some of the voyages, talking about the straining in a manner intended for him to hear, and yet he states that he never considered it his duty to ascertain if there was any ground for their observations. There can be no doubt that this staining was aggravated by the speed the Benachie would appear to have been driven at when loaded with such heavy cargoes. Upon a careful review of the whole evidence, we can come to no other conclusion than that the ship was generally on her homeward voyages overladen. The cargoes of iron are not only much in excess of the coal cargoes, but, stowed as they were, without trunkways, must have brought excessive strain on every part of the ship, and we have no doubt whatever that the cause of the foundering was from the starting of a butt or plate which had been previously overstrained by the excessive weight of the cargo she had carried on her former voyages. We are further of opinion that, taking into consideration the cargo the Benachie had onboard at the time of her loss, her clear side was far too small. This, it is true, was not the direct cause of her loss; but it is our duty to point out that to sail with so low a freeboard was unquestionably hazardous. Captain Taylor asserted that the master, G.E. Fentie was responsible for the homeward cargo. and Captain Fentie himself assumed that responsibility. At the same time it is manifest to all who have had much experience in shipping matters that an energetic master has a strong temptation to bring home such cargoes as will make his vessel as remunerative to his employers as possible. It also appears that Captain Fentie was not discouraged in bringing home such cargoes as were, in our opinion, excessive. There is no evidence to show that Messrs. Adams and Co. were directly aware of the effect of the ore cargoes in their ships, but we do think that the very large cargoes their ship carried should have caused them to make proper inquiries as to her capability of carrying them.. But we can easily understand, judging from the extraordinary evidence given by Captain Taylor, their superintendent, how they may have been misled. The absurdity of his opinion that two feet of clear side was quite safe must be apparent even to non-nautical minds when sending a ship to encounter the heavy seas of Bay of Biscay, which are frequently as high as 20 feet. We have little reason to doubt that the witnesses were correct in saying that many vessels engaged in the coal and iron ore trades are to be seen as deeply laden as the Benachie but that circumstance renders it all the more important that we should point out the danger attending such a practices, and unhesitatingly pronounce our condemnation of it.

Perth Gazette, 12 March 1852 (re Australian Gold Rush):
'... emigration to Victoria from South Australia continuing on most gigantic scale... so difficult was it to obtain a crew for any other place than Melbourne that only one wool ship, the Benjamin Elkin, had left for England, whose crew wages were paid of from £50 to £60 each before heaving the anchor'.

The Courier, Hobart, 9 March 1854:
'Shipwrecks at Port Fairy (Victoria) - The gales of Sunday last produced disastrous results at Port Fairy. Three fine barques (of which Benjamin Elkin one) were blown ashore and have become total wrecks. The Benjamin Elkin was fully loaded and cleared out for London. Her cargo consisted of 1190 bales of wool and three casks of tallow. We have no information of loss of life. Portions of the cargoes will no doubt be saved'.

* Note: Despite Hobart Courier's report that BENJAMIN ELKIN was one of ""three fine barques"" blown ashore and become total wrecks 5/3/1854 at Port Fairy, Victoria, she appears to have been salvaged in view of the following report (apparently the same ship):-

Glasgow Herald, 27 July 1855:
Accounts from Mazatlan (Pacific Coast of Mexico) announce considerable destruction of British shipping by a severe gale 15th June.  In the night a violent south wind arose, the storm became furious, the craft became unmanageable, were brought into violent collision with one another, six of the vessels were nearly entirely destroyed and 23 of crews drowned.  The cargoes lost are estimated at above 1 million dollars. Vessels lost include the British ship BENJAMIN ELKIN, from Liverpool, with a return cargo of iron and copper, 2 of crew being drowned.

There is some conflict over this loss, as another BOLIVAR, port of registry Dundee with 303 tons was reported lost by the Dundee Courier in November of 1862 after not being heard from since December 1861. Our researchers believe that the wreck at Colon in 1862 is the Aberdeen built BOLIVAR.

16 March 1890 - foundered off Cape Finisterre while on maiden voyage from Blyth to Malta with a cargo of coal.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 25+27/3/1890:
Narrative of loss of steamer BONACCORD from Capt. Charles R. Davidson: - ""It is only 3 weeks today since BONACCORD left Aberdeen on her maiden trip to Blyth. We loaded coal for Malta & after satisfactory trial over the measured mile. Left on 10 March & all went well till 20 miles off Cape Fiwisterre, when gale set in combined with heavy seas and later by terrific squalls. BONACCORD was now labouring & straining heavily and at times large quantities of water were shipped. Engineer reported that pumps were unable to cope with what was seen to be a leak in No.2 hold. All hands were called and every effort made by shipping the deck pumps & bailing water from stokehold. However, starboard fires were soon drowned out and (a terrible undertaking), engine room ballast tank cover removed. Engineers were working in water up to their wecks. Centrifugal pump was then got into use & starboard fires relit. Course was set for land in hope of getting assistance from some passing vessel. Efforts were made to pump, bail, keep steam up and to right her by trimming coals from one side to the other, but water continued to gain. Sunday morning our rockets attracted attention of French steamer MARIE, which came as close as she could, but on my asking for a tow, she proceeded on her way without rendering any aid. Our ensign was then hoisted ""Union down"" as signal of distress. About same time LUCENT of Sunderland & ANGLIA of Glasgow approached. LUCENT made off, but with great difficulty ANGLIA attached tow rope. Lifeboat from ANGLIA attempted to attach rope, first 2 attempts unsuccessful, with 2 men in lifeboat narrowly escaping being drowned & rope breaking. ANGLIA made determined effort to tow BONACCORD to port, despite continuing heavy gale & high sea. However, after 24 hours water in hold was level with main deck & BONACCORD went down. All hands were saved & landed at Gibraltar by ANGLIA.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 14/5/1890:
Board of trade enquiry at Aberdeen. Construction of BONACCORD was stated to have been in every way satisfactory. Master, chief officer, chief and second engineer were examined at length. None of witnesses were aware of anything which could have caused leak.

Glasgow Herald, 21/5/1890:
Judgement of board of trade enquiry - Court, while of opinion captain of BONACCORD was undoubtedly guilty in more than one respect of grave error of judgement, did not think its self justified in disturbing his position as a certified master."

'The same day, another bill given in by Alexander Davidson, timber man in Saint Andrews, made mention that he has agreed with the honest men that he has bought the wood of Drum, for enough timber as will build a bark, which bark he intends, God willing, to build within this town, and because the churchyard of Trinity Brothers, which is filthily abused by rubbish heaps, is the most meet and convenient place for building of the said bark, seeing as the timber is ready in one flood to come to this burgh just as soon as the water grows, was at length contented in his said bill, wherein the Provost, baillies and advising council they found the desire thereof very reasonable, and granted and gave licence to the said Alexander Davidson to build his ship in the aforementioned place, viz. in the churchyard of Trinity Brothers, conform to the desire of said supplication, and to that effect ordains all those who have laid rubbish in the said churchyard or thereabouts, to remove and take away the same within eight days next after the date hereof, under the pain of law.'

Aberdeen Press & Journal, July 1 1975:
'15 safe in double drama at sea'
'An Aberdeen trawler was crippled by fire and a Thurso fishing boat exploded and sank in northern waters early yesterday.
Fire broke out in the engine room of the Aberdeen trawler BRACONDENE when she was fishing six miles off Sumburgh Head, Shetland.
Seamen from two Royal Navy ships spent most of the day fighting the blaze.  Last night the Aberdeen trawler BEN ASDALE had a line aboard the 14-year-old vessel, owned by George Wood (Aberdeen) Ltd.
Crew Safe
It is understood that the BRACONDENE'S skipper, Mr Andrew Bennett (46), 8 Lochnagar Road, and mate Mr James Conway, 5 Wingate Place, both Aberdeen, are on board.
The rest of the crew were taken to Lerwick by the naval mine hunter HMS KELLINGTON.  They are chief engineer John Flett, 17 Seaton Avenue; second engineer Robert Palmer, 38 Menzies Road; second fisherman John Anderson, 29 Stewart Terrace; cook John Morrice, c/o 11E Linksfield Place, all Aberdeen...
It was at 5.22 yesterday morning when Lerwick Coastguards picked up a ""MayDay"" call from the Aberdeen-built BRACONDENE.
The KELLINGTON, the minesweeper HMS UPTON and the BEN ASDALE quickly answered the distress signal.  Crew members who had to abandon the 116ft trawler were rescued by the KELLINGTON...
An RN spokeman at Pitreavie Castle, Dunfermline, Fife, said last night that it was 1.15pm before the fire was finally extinguished.  It also took a large part of the afternoon to pump water from the vessel.  
The spokesman added that the BRACONDENE'S mess deck and engine room had been burned out.
The trawler's crew spent last night at the Royal National Mission for Deep Sea Fishermen in Lerwick.  They will be flying back to Aberdeen this morning.
The fire-striken trawler was under tow last night and heading for her home port.
The BRACONDENE is no new-comer to misfortune.  For since she was built in 1961 she:
- Has had to be helped back to Aberdeen after engine failure
- Has been in collision with a Macduff fishing boat, and
- Has lost a mate overboard.
The BRACONDENE was launched from the shipyard of Messrs John Lewis and Sons Ltd., Torry, Aberdeen.  Nearly four years later she broke down off Buchanness while outward bound for the fishing grounds.
In 1972 the vessel was involved in a collision with the dual-purpose seiner APOLLO in thick fog 35 miles north-east of Fraserburgh.  Five crewmen on the APOLLO cheated death by a hairsbreadth.
And in January of this year the BRACONDENE had to search waters 75 miles south-east of Aberdeen after her mate was found to be missing.'"

Aberdeen Journal, 30/11/1853:
On evening of 20 November brig Palmyra arrived in Sunderland having on board Captain Daniel and crew of schooner Brigand, of Aberdeen, with which she had been in contact about 6 am that day on clear and fair morning. According to master of Brigand, on seeing Palmyra near her, she was hailed repeatedly to alter her course, but without effect. Brigand was struck on larboard bow and cut down to water's edge. Vessels were engaged together but cleared in about 20 minutes. All crew of Brigand except master got aboard Palmyra during this period. Boat was then put out and took master off wreck of Brigand, which soon after sank about 6 miles from land. 3 of crew who were below had very narrow escape, managing to get out of forecastle through a hole made by collision, but 2 of them injured. Palmyra received little injury, and this account of how the collision happened questioned by master of Palmyra.

Melbourne Argus, 15/01/1850:
You will oblige me by inserting in your pages reply to a letter signed W. Murray, Master of the ship BRILLIANT in the Daily News Oct 7 - this pilot claims Murray agreed to wait from Sunday to Monday for departure and regrets he was detained on Monday at court.  In reply to an article, I may say a cowardly attack in the Daily News Sept 4th, speaking of my success of grounding two ships... why should I be singled out and have not the whole of the pilots occasionally grounded vessels?

Melbourne Argus, 07/10/1854:
Geelong 6 Oct.  On the arrival of the clipper ship BRILLIANT several of the townspeople interested in the advancement of the port intimated that if Capt. Murray would bring her over the bar into the inner harbour they would give him a public dinner.  The vessel could have very easily been brought in as she only drew 15 feet of water on her arrival from London.  But it appears either cheaper or more convenient to discharge and reload her seven miles from port... I should think Captain Murray too good a judge to throw away money... I think there is little doubt the BRILLIANT could take all her wool on board off the wharf after discharging her present cargo.

Melbourne Argus, 22/12/1855:
There has been little business done in the gold market during the last week.  A very few lots have been making up for the ship BRILLIANT.

Melbourne Argus, 16/02/1861:
Deaths: On 24 August 1860 at sea on the homeward voyage from Callao, Capt. William Murray of the ship BRILLIANT of Aberdeen.

Lubbock, The Colonial Clippers (1948 Ed. pp118-9):
Commanded by Captain Murray and sailing under Duthie's house-flag, BRILLIANT became a very popular passenger clipper at the time of the gold rush.  On her first outward passage she went from London to Melbourne in 87 days, and this was about her average.  She generally loaded wool for the London market at Geelong and made the homeward run in under 90 days... BRILLIANT on one occasion brought home seven tons of gold, giving Captain Murray an anxious time until he had it safely handed over to the Bank of England.  After a dozen years as a first class passenger and wool clipper the BRILLIANT was debased to the guano and nitrate trades, being finally lost at sea when homeward bound from Callao with a cargo of guano.

Newcastle Morning Herald, 3/12/1888:
Ship BRILLIANT of John Duthie & Co.’s. Famous Aberdeen line of clippers arrived yesterday from Sydney in tow. She has been chartered to load wool for the London March sales - is the largest vessel ever to be placed on the wool berth here and shows rising importance of Newcastle in direct exportation of wool to the London market. Every effort will be made to get her away about 20 Dec. with about 7700 bales of wool. BRILLIANT was built expressly for London-Sydney trade and has remained on it except for 2 voyages. In the matter of spreading her white wings she has had a brilliant career. Except on one occasion (last year when she was dismasted) she has never exceeded 90 days either to or from London, while 70 days is among her smartest performances. Capt. Charles w. Davidson has been in command since her launch & is one of the most popular skippers in the service. His fine craft is the acme of order both below & aloft. Capt. Davidson is confident the vessel will enter the Thames in ample time for the March sales.

Sydney Morning Herald, 4/10/1892:
At about 9:45 last night fir was discovered in hold of ship BRILLIANT, lying at north coast co.’s. Wharf, Sydney. Large quantities of dunnage wood, with ropes & sails, were destroyed and a quantity of deck planking & a no. of the upward supports severely burned. On arrival of fire brigade 2 lines of hose were led out. Dense volume of smoke issue from main hatch and fire was seen to be blazing freely on tween decks. One fireman with a respirator was lowered. He poured copious stream of water onto fire round & aft of mast. Within 10 minutes density of smoke decreased & half an hour after its discovery outbreak had been completely subdued. Examination showed that fire had extended from main hatchway to about 30ft. aft. Capt. Davidson, when questioned about the fire, said he could not account for it.

Bulk of her cargo is now in store for her & she was to be sent for the January sales. Survey showed that whole of the deck will have to be renewed and the iron plate and stringers taken out, straightened & repaired. Ship will go into dock tomorrow and Capt. Davidson fully intends that vessel will be ready to start for the January wool sales.

Well known Aberdeen clipper ship BRILLIANT has added another to her many fast passages by making the run to London in 79 days. She was the last ship despatched from Sydney for the January wool sales, taking 7001 bales and was amongst the first arrivals at home.  For 3rd year in succession she has made the run home in less than 83 days, proving that she is one of the fastest ships in the trade.

On 23 Nov. met with furious gale from SSW. Barometer fell rapidly & next day gale increased to hurricane force. Sea was mountainous and ship laboured heavily, while decks were constantly flooded. On that day two back stays carried away & two of sails were lost. In Addition to some of deck gear which was washed overboard, squalls were extremely violent and Capt. Carlton & his officers had grave fears for safety of the masts. Towards evening force of the wind was terrific. Sea was awful and BRILLIANT was drifting helplessly into Bay of Biscay.

Sydney Shipping: Arrived at the Heads August 4, BRITISH MERCHANT, ship, the downs.

Moreton Bay Coutier, 11/09/1860:
The clipper ship BRITISH MERCHANT, of 900 tons, was totally destroyed by fire at Sydney on morning of 2nd inst.  Captain Duthie states that at about 3.00am he was awoke by a crash.  He felt stupefied from a suffocating sensation, but contrived to get the cabin window down and saw flames coming up the quarter-hatch.  He at once hurried ashore with Mrs Duthie, the fire even scorching him as he passed the gangway.  Having placed her in safety he gave the alarm.  So dense was the smoke in the cabin that the officers were nearly suffocated before they got clear.  The port master hurried on board and gave orders for the ship to be hove off into the stream so as to save the stores and wharf.  When the ship was clear of the wharf Capt. Duthie commenced scuttling her, causing the ship to list over considerably.  The steamer WASHINGTON now towed her down the harbour to Gemorne Point, where she was anchored about 100 yards from the shore.  It being considered more prudent to get her into shallow water.  She was warped with her head on the rocks.  Two holes were made on her port side and she gradually settled down by the stern.  So dangerous had it become on her passage down the harbour that the man at the wheel jumped overboard, but the Chief Officer quicky took his place.  About 6.30am the main and mizzen masts went by the board and shortly after the foremast also fell (but most of yards and upper spars expected to be saved, as also tallow and cocoanut oil from cargo). Capt. Duthie and the Officers have lost everything, but the crew fortunately saved all their things. Capt. Duthie is utterly at a loss to account for the accident, but is of opinion it originated near the main mast and close to where are kept the ship's paint and oil stores.  The BRITISH MERCHANT was owned by Messrs Duthie & Son of Aberdeen and was only half insured.  She had aboard 100 bars railway iron, original cargo from London and homeward cargo 2000 hides, 85 tons cocoanut oil and 35 casks tallow."

""Budding Rose PD 84 built in Lewis Shipyard Aberdeen
In early 1973 after a period when my father was repeatedly asked to go relief skipper in different boats including William Morgan’s Sundari, after visiting the John Lewis shipyard in Aberdeen with William Morgan (who's new vessel Sundari was building at the time) my father decided to build a new vessel in partnership with the Don fishing company with John Stephen as mate, and Walter Strachan as engineer. In the summer of 1974 while waiting for his new vessel to be completed my father went relief skipper of the Boy Andrew Wk174 working the seine-net very successfully South-east of Peterhead. 
On October 4th 1974 at Lewis Shipyard in Aberdeen the 84 foot steel seine-net trawler Budding Rose PD84 was launched. My father fished the herring pair trawl at the west coast grounds, and the seine-net out of Peterhead. In 1975 he was joined by my brother James, and then in 1977 by my brother Peter"".

South Australian Register, 14/4/1870:
From letter received from passenger by the MURRAY, dated London 27/2/1870, ""As a set-off to the self-glorification indulged by Captain Phillips of the BUNDALEER - the MURRAY is the only ship from Adelaide, Sydney or Melbourne which started in November last which made the February [wool] sales [in London]. We were in company with BUNDALEER for a fortnight. She is no match for the MURRAY in a breeze, but in light winds had the advantage.""

Adelaide Evening Journal, 3/7/1873:
Letter from James Ramsay, master of BUNDALEER, re previous issue detailing loss of second officer during BUNDALEER's voyages. ""Lest it should be thought that rescue efforts were possible, but neglected, to save Mr. Castle. Had the report more fully set out the critical position of the ship + entire crew, the absolute necessity which compelled us to continue the ship's course would have been apparent. Appalling as was momentary spectacle of out shipmate in the water without our being able to assist, it was at once seen that any attempt to bring the ship to would have been a mad one, as the loss of the ship + all hands would probably have ensued.""

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 10/02/1879:
Deaths - at Port Adelaide, South Australia, on 28 December last, Captain Alexander McLean, ship BUNDALEER, of Aberdeen, aged 59, much and deeply regretted by a wide circle of friends.

Newcastle [New South Wales] Morning Herald, 12/5/1897:
Barque BUNDALEER has reached Freemantle, W. Australia, after eventful voyage from Puget Sound [USA]. During a gale encountered soon after she left the sound, she sprang a leak. Large quantity of timber stowed on deck had to be thrown overboard. Damage was repaired + all was well till Cape Lewis, when heavy gale sprang up in which she lost her rudder. A jury rudder was rigged until she reached Rottnest Island, when this gave way, leaving her at the mercy of the waves. Distress signal was hoisted + tug Eleanor went to her rescue."

For sale by public roup within Lemon Tree tavern, Aberdeen, for be hoof of creditors at greatly reduced prices, 1/8 schooner BYRON, upset price reduced to £60. (22/4/1829, $55)

Hull Packet, 18/5/1830:
Schooner BYRON, of Aberdeen, laden with stones, on entering Shields harbour was struck by a heavy sea, which carried away her mainmast. She became unmanageable & ran ashore between Mr. Wall's building ground & Clifford's Fort.

Newcastle Courant, 15/1/1831:
To be sold by auction at Sunderland, schooner BYRON of Sunderland, Thomas Hunter master, built Aberdeen 1825, completely ripped in 1830, had a new keel & keelson, with other very extensive repairs to the hull; her outfit of sails and stores at the same time chiefly new to amount of nearly £600. She is now consequently abundantly found in every requisite, having made but one voyage to Bordeaux. She has delivered 80 tons hemp, 722 barrels tar, 878 quarters oats, 7 1/2 keel’s coals at 10 1/2 feet water. She it a very fast sailor, requires little ballast, shifts without any. She is a very desirable vessel for the corn, coal, Oporto or charter trade; requires nothing but provisions to send her to sea. Particulars from Munro & Bluker, Sunderland.

Wrecked Embo, nr Dornoch, 15/09/1839:

Morning Chronicle, 21/9/1839:
Schooner BYRON, of Newcastle, from North Shields for Inverness with coals, was totally lost on the rocks of Embo, two miles east of Dornoch. Crew consisted of master, John R. Smith, mate William Mackay, a native of Thurso, three seamen and a boy. These with exception of mate have perished. For night & day previously it blew a perfect gale on that coast from north east with rain. When night fell the darkness was excessive, so that Tarbatness lighthouse was not observed until vessel had got to north of it & into Dornoch Firth. Attempt was then made to veer round, but this was found impracticable from fury of gale, all the canvas but the foretopsail having gone. Shortly after this the schooner struck the rocks on the Embo shore & very soon went to pieces. Mate wandered about the fields near shore till daylight when, nearly exhausted, he found his way to mansion house of Embo, residence of Mr. Brander, who treated him with the greatest kindness & attentions. He immediately proceeded to the shore with his farm servants in hope of saving remainder of crew, but no trace of them could be discovered.

The schooner 'BYRON', carrying a cargo of coal under Capt. Smith, was wrecked at Embo near Dornoch on 15th September 1839.

Launch - On Thursday, there was launched from the building yards to Messrs. Duthie & Sons an iron sailing vessel of the following dimensions: Length, 273 feet; width, 39 feet; depth, 25 feet 3 inches; registered tonnage, 1600. The vessel is to be full-rigged, and will sail in the Australian trade, under the command of Captain Birnie. She has been built for Mr William Duthie of Cairnbulg, and co-owners. On entering the water she was named the CAIRNBULG by Mr Robert Duthie, Mrs Birnie, who was to have performed the ceremony, having, along with the other ladies, left the scene on account on the intended postponement of the launch.

Aberdeen Press and Journal, 8/4/1874:
The new iron shear poles, at the Dock Gates, were successfully raised on Tuesday last week. The poles are warranted to carry eighty tons, about thirty tons more than the old wooden ones. The winch is wrought by steam power. The cost of the whole will be a little over £5000. The first ship to be masted by the new shear poles will be the CAIRNBULG, a large iron vessel, just launched from the Messrs Duthie's yard.

Liverpool Mercury, 01/11/1878:
En route London - Sydney, heavy westerly gale set in 29 July 42S, 56E [Southern Ocean]. On 31 July a hurricane struck the ship, blowing the mizzen lower topsail out of the hands of the men stowing it and breaking the iron fore and main yards. New topsails and foresails disappeared in shreds. The ship broached to, heaving her almost on her beam ends. Though there was not a vestige of sail set, everything on the foremast above the cap went over the side. Main topmast was then blown away. After further loss of gear the ship was righted, but was surrounded by wreckage. Master was unconscious for 6 hours after being struck by something. Wreckage threatened to pierce hull, but it was some time till it was safe to clear it. Amsterdam Island was passed on 8 August, by which time temporary repairs were almost completed. On arrival Sydney passengers presented address to Capt. Birnie stating his self-possession, bravery and seamanship were, under the blessing of God, the means of saving the ship and the lives of all aboard.

Newcastle [New South Wales] Morning Herald, 30/4/1888:
Famous Aberdeen clipper ship CAIRNBULG, which has earned such a high reputation in the wool trade between Sydney and London for many years, is one of large fleet to have arrived recently from San Francisco. She has only once before visited Newcastle (some 4 years ago). She has a yacht like appearance + her pretty appearance was favourably commented on by those who claim to be nautical experts. Like majority of Aberdeen liners, she was built for speed + her last voyage London-Sydney was of 74 days. Capt. Charles Waltham has sailed in every capacity from apprentice to Captain with the firm + although still young is highly esteemed in Anglo-Australian service. CAIRNBULG has come to Newcastle to load 2230 tons coal for 'Frisco. She left the Golden Gates 19 March + following 10 days had rough weather + adverse winds, moderate weather then to equator, crossed 2 April. Then variable weather till 200 miles off Lord Howe Island, after which fine weather to port.

Sydney Mail, 20/7/1889:

She left on 16 April + had pretty fair passage down channel, passed Lizard 18 April + did well to the line in 21 days, crossed 7 may in 20 degrees west. S.E. trades poor. Cape of Good Hope passed 4 June under 2 lower topsails + foresail. 12 June Hove to on Port Tack in 45 degrees South, 50 degrees East [just north of Southern ocean] in gale from NNE which lasted 3 full days. The sea rose to a fearful height + deluged the decks, volumes of water found their way aft into the saloon. A heavy body of water struck the forward house + stove in the sides. Raging torrents rushed about ships decks =+ it had feared some water got below [into cargo], a lad was knocked down + badly hurt + is still off duty. Weather was almost as bad all the way across Southern Ocean. Meridian of Cape Leowan passed 24 June + Tasmania rounded 6 days later. Master is again Capt. Waltham. Chief Officer is Mr. George Murray.

Aberdeen Journal, 19th January 1853:
'LAUNCH OF A MAGNIFICENT CLIPPER.  Last week there was launched, from the building yard of Messrs A. Hall and Sons, a splendid clipper ship, named the Cairngorm.  The vessel, owing to the extreme sharpness of her bottom, was launched on a cradle yesterday week, when there was not sufficient water to float her off; it was then deemed necessary to remove the cradle, and on Saturday the launch was accomplished, to the entire satisfaction of all concerned, and she was floated into the Victoria Dock to receive her equipment.  
The dimensions of the Cairngorm are - length, 200 feet between perpendiculars; extreme breadth, 36½ feet; depth of hold, 20½ feet.  Her tonnage is 1250 om, or 980 nm. Messers Jardine, Mathison, and Co., China  merchants, are the owners; and the vessel is built expressly for the China trade. She will be commanded by Captain John Robertson, whose services, first in the John O’Gaunt, and more recently in the Stornoway, are well known. 
In the latter vessel he has, for the last two years, successfully run the race of competition in carrying the first of the new teas from China to this country.  The Cairngorm is, we believe, the largest sailing vessel ever before built in Scotland; and is certainly about the finest.  Her sailing qualities, we are confident, will prove of the very first order, and in carrying power there is every reason to believe she will be equally capable.  The Cairngorm lies at Waterloo Quay, and is well worth seeing, as an admirable model of a vessel combining immense size with great elegance of appearance.

Ran Lisbon to Hong Kong in 72 days.

Left Macao Roads 7 Aug. and passed Scilly lights 12 Nov., thus making passage from land to land in 97 days, which considering time of year she had to pass through China seas, is most excellent work and we believe has never been surpassed.

1/8 of coppered brig CALEDONIAN, burden by register 236, for sale by private bargain.

Caledonian Mercury, 9/2/1835:
Walter Hamilton arrived Aberdeen from Girgenti, Sicily, where she left brig CALEDONIAN, of Glasgow.

Morning Post, 27/11/1837:
The brig CALEDONIAN, of Green dock, on voyage from Quebec to this country, became on 30 October waterlogged & on following day lost her rudder and was capsized. 2 of her people, with the whole of her provisions, were washed overboard, while the rest of the crew were left on the wreck without food for 13 days, and were ultimately to sustain life reduced to the frightful necessity of devouring their comrades as they one after another died from cold, fatigue and starvation. 3 had perished in this miserable manner when the Russian ship DYGDEN, of Bjurneborg, fell in with the wreck in lat. 55N long. 15W [off West Coast of Ireland]. Sea was at the time running so high that it appeared impossible to render the wretched survivors on the wreck the least assistance, and they must have been left to perish but for humane & brave conduct of Otto Reing Spoof, the mate of the Russian ship, who lashed a rope around his body & launching a boat, made his way on his own to the assistance of the unhappy sufferers. The attempt was hazardous in the extreme, but was happily crowned with success & 6 were rescued. They arrived safely at Bristol in the DYGDEN, testimonial to be raised for rescuer, authenticated by hand of Mr David Cock, late master of CALEDONIAN.

Bristol Mercury, 16/12/1837:
Subscriptions being raised for gallant mate of the DYGDEN and for relief of the 6 unfortunate sufferers.

[Lloyd's Register 1833 shows 2 brigs named CALEDONIAN - one 358 tons built St. Johns, 18 years before and the other 236 tons built Aberdeen 9 years before. 1839 register shows that only the former is still registered. It this seems highly likely that the CALEDONIAN wrecked in 1837 was the one built in Aberdeen in 1825]

Vessel disappeared without trace on its second voyage in the China Sea.  Captain Daniel Ritson and his wife Eliza were on board and lost with the vessel in 1871.

Basil Lubbock's book 'The China Clippers' conjectures that the vessel was possibly captured by pirates in a calm or she could have been lost in a gale.

The Brisbane Courier, 15/05/1871:
'The English tea clipper Caliph, built by Hall of Aberdeen on the lines of the celebrated schooner Silene, arrived at New York on March 3rd, from Foochow, after the fastest passage ever made between the two ports.  She left Foochow on December 7; passed Anjer on the tenth day out; and rounded the Cape of Good Hope of January 18th - 41 days out.  Her run thence to New York occupied only 44 days - in all 85 days.  The American papers state that the average run between the two ports is 110 days.'

Mr John Simpson, Shanghai

Dear Sir,

We duly received your kind favour of the 25th Feby for which please accept out warmest thanks. Your letter came all the more welcome as we have not had a scrap of news from any one else on board. We can assure you that it gives us very great satisfaction to have such a favourable account given by a gentleman of your experience and now when we understand how matters stood we do not wonder at the ship not having made a better passage.

We were much disappointed when we learned who was to command the ship we had been at so much trouble with seeing that nobody appeared to know anything of the man nor of his former exploits and could never understand why Mr Hector shipped him.
When we contracted with Mr Hector to build the “Caliph”, we did so at a price which we knew would not pay as otherwise we would not have got the contract, hoping that we would build a ship that would be a credit to us. We spared no pains, and had more bother with her than we would have had with half a dozen other ships owning to the peculiarities of the owner and his inspector, and when she was complete and ready for sea the owner puts in a man nobody knows anything about you can understand how annoying that is. We are confident that the topgallant mast and bowsprit should not have given way with fair play but what you say fully explains the matter.
 
You would much oblige is if you would allow us to make use of your letter, for it is highly probable that we will have a long list of complaints from Mr Hector and should “The Caliph” not come in as first ship in the Tea Race, of which we must say we have now little hope, the whole blame will be thrown on us for not building a faster ship, but your letter would show that there are two sides of the question.

Again thanking you for the trouble you have taken.

We are
Yours truly
A. Hall & Co.
William Hall Junior.

The Cromer lifeboat Ruby and Arthur Reed was called to the ST MARK shortly before she sank on 6 August 1990. The lifeboat had been launched at 1620 Following a Mayday call from the vessel which had been in collision with a tug towing barges about 6 miles north east of the station. The ten men aboard the casualty had taken to her own lifeboats and were picked up by another vessel which had been only four miles away when the collision occurred.
ST MARK sank quickly, but she was in a busy shipping lane so the lifeboat stood by until she had sunk completely at 2030, in 85 ft of water, before towing the ship's lifeboats ashore. Due to the heavy swell she was unable to re-house at Cromer and put into Great Yarmouth before returning the following day.""

Sailed 12 July, CARNAQUEEN, Ship, James Ramsay Master, for London.

South Australian Register (Adelaide), 19/09/1872:
[From Wallaroo Times] Considerable excitement in Wallaroo when it was known elder liner CARNAQUEEN was hard and fast on Tipara Reef (Spencer Gulf). Capt. Colville was on the Gulf for first time. He was aware of the reef, set what he thought correct course and went to his cabin to rest. When he came on deck he considered land too near and ordered course to be altered, but soon after she struck the reef at 6 knots. Water was pumped out of her and also over 100 tons of coal unloaded. At high water she began to move on the reef, but could not be kedged off. A steamer, sent from Adelaide, arrived just in time to pull her clear. CARNAQUEEN is an Aberdeen clipper ship. The Captain has a share in her and probably will be the greatest sufferer from the misfortune.

South Australian Advertiser, 24/09/1880:
News reached London 22 Sept. that ship CARNAQUEEN, A1, Capt. J. Simpson, belonging to Messrs Jacobs Bros & Co. of London, bound from Antwerp to Sydney, has foundered at sea. It is feared that a large number of those aboard have perished."

Aberdeen Journal, 26/09/1855:
The fine new ship CATHERINE ADAMSON, launched here recently, sailed from the bay on Saturday evening at 7 o'clock and a telegraphic dispatch has been received notifying her arrival in the West India Docks, London, yesterday forenoon (Tuesday) at 11 o'clock, a splendid run.

The Era, 13/07/1856:
The ship CATHERINE ADAMSON, Captain Stewart, sailed from Sydney 16 April and arrived in the Downs on 9th inst., thus making the passage in the short space of 83 days.

Hocking, Dictionary of Disasters at Sea:
The clipper ship CATHERINE ADAMSON was bound from Aberdeen to Sydney, N.S.W., with a general cargo. On October 24, 1857 in rough weather she took shelter off the Inner North Head, Sydney, but dragged her anchors and drifted ashore and sank. 21 persons were drowned. The ship was in the care of a pilot at the time.

Wreck, North Heads, Sydney, 24/10/1857:
Conflicting reports given in newspaper report of wreck and in report of inquest (NLA Australian Newspapers BETA):

'The Empire' Newspaper Report:
Chief Officer (un-named) stated pilot Hawkes stood across several times to get to an anchorage, but owing to violence of gale and heavy sea was compelled to bring up in a dangerous position. He claimed that pilot turned down offer of tow by Capt. Creagh of steamer 'WILLIAMS' on grounds she had not enough power and requested Creagh to go into Sydney and send out tug. However, Creagh stood by. A squall threw 'CATHERINE ADAMSON' onto rocks, she being anchored too close to shore, and she became total wreck in one hour. Boats were lowered and took passengers and crew to 'WILLIAMS' , which kept as close alongside as possible. Nevertheless, 3 cabin passengers, pilot, 2nd mate and about 15 others drowned.
Capt. Stuart of 'CATHERINE ADAMSON' issued statement which gave quite different account. He claimed anchorage would have been safe if weather had remained moderate and that the 'WILLIAMS' had tried unsuccessfully to take 'CATHERINE ADAMSON' in tow. The ships gig and lifeboat got successfully to the 'WILLIAMS' (Capt. Stuart being in the latter to ask the steamer to come closer to the wreck and with the intention of returning. However, gig and lifeboat were swamped alongside the steamer).
At the Inquest (29/10/1857): One of the seamen stated that the blocks were defective before leaving England and that the ship worked badly in consequence. The Chief Officer repeated his view that the ship had been ""ridiculously handled"" by the pilot, but a seaman of 21 years' experience thought the pilot worked the ship in a proper manner. A passenger thought that all could have been saved if a united effort had been made. The evidence of the seafaring witnesses mainly exculpated the Captain from blame, but a pilot thought the Captain should have been the last to leave the ship. The Jury decided by a majority of 8 to 5 that the conduct of Capt. Stuart was blameless."

Strong gale at Mauritius 3 January. In the harbour 2 vessels were driven ashore. 4 vessels anchored at entrance to harbour were obliged to put to sea. CATTOFIELD has returned without damage.

Dundee Courier & Argus, 26/10/1868:
CATTOFIELD sailed from Leith 22 June for Penang with cargo of coals. 23 August a few miles to north of Tristan da Cunha the ship was discovered to be on fire. Flames had so much hold of the vessel that it was impossible to address their progress. On 24 August Captain decided on abandoning ship & succeeded in saving ships papers & chronometers and clothing of the crew (numbering 16). Within half an hour of abandonment a tremendous explosion took place & flames were seen rising from all her hatchways. Happily about 2 hours later the boats fell in with the ship GLENLYON, of Quebec. The men were taken aboard, hospitably received and kindly treated by Capt. Makenzie. After rounding Cape of Good Hope he intended running for Mauritius, but on 11 Sept. off Cape St. Francis sighted a barque ALETHEIA (for Dundee) and crew were by Capt. Daniel's consent transferred to his vessel & brought to Algoa Bay (Port Elizabeth, S. Africa)."

'Well, darling, the more I see of the 'Centurion' the more I am convinced the 'Queen' would beat her.  I am very much annoyed at this as everyone expects she is going to do such wonders.  I can't understand it myself.  I never saw but one ship go past the 'Queen' the whole eight voyages I was in her but I have already seen several go past the 'Centurion'.  Mr Greig will have to try and alter his model...'

In a letter, later that same voyage, to his friend Captain Edward of the Thermopylae, Captain Mitchell wrote of the Centurion; 
'Since writing the previous part of this letter, the Centurion has been pleasing me hugely.  We had a day or two of rather light wind after passing the Cape [of Good Hope] but since then she has been rushing along at a great rate.  Of course, I can't compare with the Thermopylae from the start to the Otway [Cape Otway, Victoria] but I am vain enough to compare with her when I had wind...I should just like to have her alongside of me down here with plenty of wind.  We have had the weather remarkably fine.  Our main topgallant sheets have never been stowed since we left the Downs.  I am very glad the Centurion is going to do something good, if she gets the chance.'

[Extracts reproduced courtesy of Mr & Mrs Donald, Aberdeen]

From 'The Colonial Clippers' by Basil Lubbock:
""Capt. Mitchell overlooked her building and was her first commander. She was a very fast ship and he always hoped to beat the THERMOPYLAE with her, but never succeeded. On her first voyage she went out to Sydney in 69 days. It was a light weather passage and she never started the sheets of her main top gallant sail the whole way. She is stated to have made 300, 348 and 356 miles in 3 successive days running down her easting, but I have been unable to verify these runs. Capt. Mitchell died on her second voyage just before reaching the channel homeward bound. She also made some creditable tea passages, but was mostly kept in the Sydney trade. In 1871 she went out in 77 days and in 1872 in 78 days.""

The CENTURION struck rocks and broke up at North Head, Sydney Harbour, Australia on 16 January 1887.  Whilst being towed out from Sydney, the Captain of her tug, afraid he might collide with the barque MANHEGAN which was anchored nearby stopped and went astern.  The tow broke and the CENTURION drifted ashore and quickly broke up within half an hour.  All the crew were saved.
Timber, rusted metal and a chain are all that remain in 18m of water of Quarantine Head, Sydney Harbour.

Sydney Empire, 3/12/1869:
CENTURION, 965 tons, Mitchell, departed Sydney for London.

Sydney Morning Herald, 16/1/1886:
CENTURION departed Sydney 15 Jan. for Newcastle (N.S.W.) & London. Cargo included 1268 bales wool & 190 casks tallow.

Sydney Morning Herald, 17/1/1887:
Well known barque CENTURION, trader between London & Sydney for last 17 years, went on the rocks at North Head & disappeared within half an hour afterwards. She left Walker's Wharf at 1 a.m. yesterday under command of Capt. Charles Taylor for Honolulu. As she & her tug were rounding south reef a barque was seen right between the heads, apparently anchored and almost simultaneously a very heavy squall, with thick rain, came on. Tug stopped engines. Tow rope at once slackened & CENTURION began to drift away to leeward onto north head and rope parted. Capt. Taylor let go the anchor, but it had no effect & vessel struck ground and began bumping heavily & canted over on her beam ends. Pilot steamer which had been attending other barque came to rescue of crew of CENTURION, which seemed in imminent danger of being smashed to pieces (her own tug having tow rope wrapped round her propeller). With difficulty in the heavy sea 2 boats were lowered & went under the bows of CENTURION, which now pointed seawards. Watching their opportunity, CENTURION'S crew dropped into the boats, captain being last to leave, very soon afterwards CENTURION gave a great plunge forward & disappeared beneath the waves. On their arrival in Sydney they went aboard the ABERGELDIE (Aberdeen clipper owned by Duthie), where Capt. & Mrs Johnston showed them every hospitality and kindness. Neither vessel or cargo was insured, this was Capt. Charles Taylor's first voyage in CENTURION, Capt. Thomas Taylor being compelled to remain at home owing to ill health. Crew were sent to sailors home, where they received every attention.

Aberdeen Journal, 18 January 1887:
'It appears that while the 'Centurion' was being towed out of Sydney, the tow-rope snapped and the vessel being left at the mercy of a rather rough sea and a stiff breeze, was driven on the rocks...crew were all saved; the vessel became a total wreck.'

A young lad, James Smith, lost his life aboard schooner Ceres, Capt. Anderson, of this ports on passage Arbroath - London, working through the Cockle-Gat on Norfolk coast in foggy weather on 1st January. He was stationed blowing the fog horn, when Ceres was hailed by an other vessel to let down the anchor. He had been standing inside coil of rope attached to the chain, and by a sudden jerk of the anchor and chain, got entangled with the rope and was carried overboard unobserved by anyone. His cap was later seen floating along side. Captain had oars and spars to aid him, but unhappily he was not seen to rise and, the tide running strong, it was concluded that he had been carried away by the current or sunk. The fog having cleared about 2 hours later and anchor weighed, to the horror and amazement of all on board, the poor lad came up a corpse with his right ankle entangled in a 'kinch' of the buoy rope about 4 fathoms down.

1861: Master D. Finlay; Destined voyage Arbroath-Baltic.

Dundee Courier, 30/10/1862:
At about 3 pm yesterday, schooner Ceres, of Arbroath, attempted to come into Lytham in fresh breeze from westward and heavy sea, but being a stranger and unable to make out the buoys, she ran upon the Salthouse sandbank, struck heavily and sustained a great deal of damage. The Lytham lifeboat was immediately launched and induced captain and crew to remain by their vessel and attempt to bring her off next tide. They succeeded with help of the lifeboat and, pumps being kept going all the way, beached the schooner in a place of safety.

Report of wreck of CERES, of Aberdeen, near Dunbar. Storm has been very severe at North Berwick. Brig CERES, of Aberdeen, James Spence Master, is totally wrecked off Scoughall, not far from Dunbar. All on board have perished. Three bodies have been cast ashore, one supposed to be the Master, another a young man about 17 or 18.

Aberdeen Press & Journal, 15/06/1870:
Launch of an iron steamer - A fine screw steamer was launched on Monday afternoon from the yard of Messrs Leckie, Wood & Munro, at Torry. The vessel in going off was gracefully named the CERES by Miss Leckie, daughter one of the partners. Immediately after being launched, the CERES was towed across to the sheer poles at the harbour, and the work of fitting has already commenced. The vessel is 225 feet in length, 30 feet breadth of heam, and 17 feet depth of hold, and is of 983 tons gross register. Her propeller is worked by a pair of engines of 110 horsepower, on the compound principle. The consumption of fuel is not expected to be more than seven cwt. per hour, with a speed of eight knots, and a full cargo of 1400 tons dead weight. The CERES has been built on the same stocks as the RAINTON, which was launched in January, and will be commanded by Captain Langley. She has been built for Messrs Priest and Massey, Hull, and is intended for the Baltic trade."

CHAA-SZE - The name means 'Tea Taster' in Chinese.  The figurehead was unusual in that it consisted of two Chinese men supporting a shield with the name painted in Chinese characters.

The teak frames were from 4-6ft apart with a triple thickness of planking binding the whole together in 9ins of solid teak.  The planking was fastened with screw-treenails, an improvement on the normal hammered treenails which worked loose through movement.  William Hall had taken out a patent in June 1853 for screw treenails.  At cost of £100 each she was the second ship ever to have the new Emerson and Walkers patent windlass installed.

The Great Days of Sail by Andrew Shewan:
'The ship was so tightly bound that later several of her lower deck beams were made to unship to give her more play.  On one occasion she was in company, off Mauritius, with the clipper CHANTICLEER bound for China.  Having sailed together for 4 days a steady breeze got up and the CHAA-SZE forged ahead.  The master of the CHANTICLEER cried out ""There she goes they have unscrewed the beams and we shan't see her again"".  No more they did'.

The CHAA-SZE was lost when she stranded on 28th June 1876, 5 miles north of the Grand Connetable Islands, French Guiana.

Sydney Morning Herald/Empire, 19+21/4/1864:
CHAA-SZE arrived Sydney 20 March, 93 days from the downs; cleared for Hong Kong 18 April, 8 Chinese passengers. Sheway master.

In order that consigners should suffer as little as possible the greatest expedition has been observed in discharging, which is now completed with exception of about 30 tons (which is retained as stiffening until her dead weight is sent aboard).

Gawler Police court, 13 Sept. WM Spiller was charged by Capt. Bowen with having deserted 30 August. The captain, who was on a visit to Gawler, discovered prisoner working in Murray Street & gave him in charge.

S. Australian Register, 20/8/1872:
CHAA-SZE won in charge of Capt. Brown, who was pleased to find a pilot ready to take the vessel to a berth. Capt. Brown reports having left downs 10 May, light variable winds till passing Madeira, then moderate north east trades. Line crossed 5 June. Southerly trades proved very light and, like other ships, CHAA-SZE was driven well over to South American coast. On 26 June heavy gale from south east, attended by a confused sea. 14 July passed Cape of Good Hope & thence some good runs were achieved. The easting was bowled alone on parallel of 40-41 south. Finally a hard gale set in, during which a heavy sea broke on board, filling deck & forecastle, smashing spares & otherwise knocking about the woodwork.

Evening Journal (Adelaide), 10/9/1872:
Cleared out Adelaide 9 Sept. for Sydney & Newcastle, John Brown master, carrying for Sydney 3,800 bags and 812 half bags flour & 637 bags wheat and for Newcastle 1295 bags, 224 half bags & 400 quarter bags flour and 100 tons copper ore.

Queenslander, 12/11/1936:
CHAA-SZE was originally intended to be a steam whaler, but firm which ordered her failed. She had been modelled on tea clipper lines & was finished as a sailing vessel. She figured quite creditably in the tea races."

Aberdeen Journal, 29 August 1860:
LAUNCH - On Saturday, 18th inst, there was launched from the building yard of our townsmen, Messrs Hall another fine 13A1 vessel of 500 tons, named ""CHEPICA"" for Messrs Barnes & Co. Liverpool, intended for the trade twixt that port and the west coast of America.  She is commanded by Captain Gales, an experienced tar in those parts, has her lower masts and bowsprits of iron, is a strong handsome craft, and will leave this complete on 1st September.  The ""Flying Spur"" launched by the same firm on the 1st inst. sailed from this on Monday week for London to lay on for Bombay and China; and a more completely finished or better looking clipper, we are certain never left our shores.  This proves that our builders not only are determined to maintain the position they have so acquired, but to take the lead in turning out the first class ships of the day.

CHRYSOLITE raced the American clipper MEMNON through the treacherous coral reef at Island of Banca where the MEMNON was wrecked. The brokers were so impressed the CHRYSOLITE was able to command a guinea extra freight.  

In 1852 she won the race home from China with the new seasons teas against the STORNOWAY.

Aberdeen Journal, December 10th 1851:

'Remarkable passages by Aberdeen Clippers - 
We observe also that the fine ship ""Chrysolite"" of Liverpool, which was launched here last spring, has fully realized the expectations which were then entertained of her sailing capabilities having made the passage out and home from China in the shortest passage ever known. The Liverpool mail says ""Our American friends have been making great struggles to beat us in the China trade with their clipper built ships.  We are happy, however, to lay before our readers an account of the most rapid passage ever made to China and back.  The ship ""Chrysolite"", one of the famous Aberdeen clippers, the property of Messrs Taylor, Potter & Co., under the command of Captain Enright, left this port for China on the 24th April 1851, where she arrived in 102 days.  Here she discharged and took in cargo and left Whampoa for Liverpool on the 19th August and arrived home on the 1st December.  The entire passage out and home, including her detention in China, occupied seven months and six days; being the quickest passage ever made.  It should also be stated that the Chrysolite came home short-handed, seven or eight men having deserted in China to go to the diggings in Australia.""
...So far as this season's rivalry between British and American clippers in the China trade has been tested by their performances, the British builders have the best of it.'

Adelaide Observer, 29/5/1852:
Beautiful clipper ship CHRYSOLITE was built at Aberdeen by Hall & Sons for enterprising firm of Taylor & Potter for the China trade. She reached Liverpool 1st Dec. after 2 surprisingly rapid voyages of 102 days out and 104 days home, having been absent 7 months & 6 days and having completely beaten the American ship Memnon, which sailed from Whampoa 3 days before CHRYSOLITE, but she came up with Memnon on the 21st day, tried with her for 15 hours in a dead heat to windward through Casper Straits, beat her completely and left her 9 and a half miles astern. After this CHRYSOLITE fell in with H.M. frigate Havannah, a very fine & fast sailing vessel. The two were in company for 15 days & the frigate could not leave her. Officers of Havannah acknowledged she was the only ship that had been able to hold with them during their commission. CHRYSOLITE made a voyage from Liverpool to Anjer (Java) in 56 days, 9 days faster than previous fastest time by American clipper Oriental. She is well able to lead the fastest of the boasted American clippers & we understand was built expressly to contest with the Oriental. She is 440 tons (NM) and 570 tons (OM), but carries nearly 900 tons tea. The Aberdeen bow & the new law on tonnage measurement allow fast sailing & large tonnage burthen to be combined...rate of sailing by the wind 9 and a half, 10 and a half knots,  and going free all sail, 11, 12 and 13 and a half for many days together. She is very easy in all weathers. Running before heavy gales or hove to.

Maitland Mercury (NSW), 10/11/1852:
CHRYSOLITE, expected daily from China, is the celebrated clipper ship whose extraordinary passages in opposition to the Oriental have excited so much attention in England.

The Times August 17, 1883:
'THE COLONIAL NAVY. A remarkable vessel was launched yesterday from the shipbuilding yard of Messrs. Hall, Russell, and Co., Aberdeen. 
She is named the Churchill, and is of unique design. In view of the attention lately given to the question of colonial defence it may be mentioned that the maritime affairs of the colony of Natal are managed by the Natal Harbour Board, and under the auspices of this body the harbour of Port Natal, which forms the naval outlet not only to the colony of Natal, but also to the rich and important districts of the Transvaal and part of the Orange 'Free State, is being enlarged and deepened at great ex- pense. The entrance to the harbour is obstructed by a bar of shifting sand, and the sea at the outer anchorage during an easterly gale is extremely heavy. 

The completion of the harbour works and consequent removal of the bar is expected to neutralize this source of danger by allowing vessels of deep draught to enter the harbour. In the meantime, however, the Harbour Board decided to build a steam vessel suitable to the service of the port in its present state. Mr. Walker Pearce, their agent in this country, was instructed to obtain advice on the question, and on the recommendation of the Board of Trade and Sir E. J. Reed, M.P., the design was entrusted to Mr. J. F. Flannery, C.E. 

The conditions were that the vessel should tow ships into and out of the harbour over the bar in all weathers; should be capable of acting as a very powerful fire-engine ; of carrying large supplies of fresh water for the use of ships or troops: of landing troops from transports too large to enter the harbour; of succouring vessels in distress in the open sea ; of recovering the large number of derelict anchors and cables of which it is estimated that three hundred of the largest size lie along the coast, and lastly, of acting in times of need as a torpedo or coast defence vessel. 

In the vessel launched yesterday these conditions are believed to be fully met, one of the most novel features of the vessel being a large Martin anchor carried upon an overhanging platform at the stern, to which is attached a heavy cable. The loose end of this will be passed by a rocket or other apparatus to ships in danger of drifting ashore, and the Churchill will steam seawards to drop the anchor as far as possible from the shore.'

Launched 16th August 1883. Named after Joseph Fleetwood Churchill, a prominent Natal businessman, with strong political connections with the Natal Port Harbour Board.
Arrived at Port Natal on the 19th December 1883 after sailing from Plymouth 2nd November.

Reports of a sea-monster sighted by the crew of the Churchill, 31st August 1884, off the coast at Port Natal; 

'huge beast suddenly appeared level with the bulwarks presenting the most terrific appearance. It seemed covered in large sea shells and to have a big, hairy head; twice it appeared, and as suddenly plunged down again. The second time the whole of its body passed under the ship, and in doing so all aboard assert positively that its head could be seen some distance at one side while its tail was still visible many yards away at the other. It’s length was estimated at 60 feet.'
[extract from Bernard Heuvelmans' book 'In the Wake of the Sea-Serpents' 1968] 

January of 1895 the Churchill was involved in a collision with the Castle Line coaster, Venice.  
1886 steam steering gear was fitted, and engine room was enlarged.

The Churchill had a relatively short life in Durban, proving to be too low powered, she was sold to a Portuguese owner for use in Beira, on the Pungwe River in Mozambique.  She left Durban in January 1899 after just 16 years service.

CIMBA left London 25 Feb. with general cargo consigned to Rockhampton and arrived here Sunday, Capt. Holmes in command, Mr D. W. Macdonald Chief Officer and crew of 24 all told, most Englishmen. CIMBA is very fine vessel, owned by Alexander Nicol & Co. Her last 2 voyages home from Sydney took only 79 and 75 days respectively. This is her 2nd visit to Queensland, she having called at Brisbane 2 years ago. Capt Holmes said that on this voyage he met with nothing but head winds all the way from Cape of Good Hope to Tasmania, which accounted for long delay. CIMBA will remain here unloading for about 6 weeks, when she will load wool, tallow etc, for London, calling at Brisbane to complete cargo of wool etc.

Rockhampton Bulletin, 01/08/1899:
Clipper ship CIMBA, after waiting for favourable weather, left yesterday with 1317 carks tallow and 1468 bails wool, she will load about 1000 bales wool at Brisbane, then sail for London.

She behaved very well under bare poles for 30 hrs, sea being terrific.

Brisbane Courier, 25/02/1903:
Ship CIMBA, Capt. Holmes, expected to leave here tomorrow, mainly in ballast, for Chile.

Hobart Mercury, 26/11/1903:
Ship CIMBA, after leaving London for Sydney, collided with another vessel. Had to return to port and will probably have to discharge her cargo.

Adelaide Advertiser, 11/06/1906:
Ship CIMBA, which arrived Melbourne from Frederickstadt June 10, bore a somewhat dilapidated appearance forward. As result of heavy seas starboard light was wrenched from its lashings and thrown clear onto port boat. Boat on the house forward was smashed to pieces, while any amount of light fittings were beat and twisted.

Evening Express, 14 July 1954:
Fastest voyage 1889 Sydney to London in 75 days.  She had only two masters whilst she sailed under a British flag; Captain Fimister (1878-1895) and Captain Holmes (1895-1906).  'According to Master Holmes, Cimba was heavy aloft and narrow, but she was beloved by both her masters and certainly by most of the men who sailed her.'"

By this vessel also the consignment of 114 pieces of wood has been made by Dr. Crowther with a view to our indigenous hardwoods being tested in the shipyards and large public works in England.

Hobart Mercury, 18/12/1860:
By a private letter from Captain Copping of the ship CISSY, whose arrival at home was announced yesterday, we learn that his protracted passage home of 115 days has occasioned by a prevalence of easterly gales between this port and Cape Horn, off where he did not arrive until he had been out 54 days... large quantities of ice were fallen in with on the passage and the passengers suffered severely from the cold.

Brisbane Courier, 26/09/1871:
Sydney Sept. 25 - the CISSY, ship, from China, has brought eight hundred tons of sugar.
(Source: Australian Newspapers Online)

Hobart Mercury, 22/04/1874:
The ship CISSY, being short-handed, was offering £8 per month for the voyage to England, and even at that rate good men were not forth-coming.  The late successful movement of the seamen's unions, by which an advance of £1 per month was gained, has created a spirit of independence among seamen which is steadily gaining ground... men who came out from England, especially single men, shipping for a long and stormy voyage of several months, hardly seeing land all the time and receiving wages of £3 to £3.15.0 per month, cannot be easily induced to accept even the high rates of the clipper ships homeward bound... for if they stop in the colonies they can get twice, often three times, the monthly wages of homeward vessels by shipping on coastal steamers and traders which are seldom 24 hrs out of port and are not nearly so hard worked.

CLANSMAN was built as a side loading car passenger ferry operating for West Coast of Scotland and Western Isles Service.  She had side loading ramp doors forward that lead on to a vehicle lift on the car deck to when piers were higher than the ship at low tide. 

CLANSMAN was lengthened in 1973 and the side doors and lift were removed and covered in where the ship was cut in two and a new 30 foot section was fitted along with bow and stern doors.  In 1973  CLANSMAN was also updated from 1 deck to 2 decks. She now carried passengers, special cargo and vehicles and was described as a RoRo ferry - owners now David MacBrayne Ltd., Glasgow; later called Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd.   

CLANSMAN was sold in 1984 after engine trouble to Torbay Seaways but never started service as ""linkspan"" not available for RoRo service, replaced by HEBRIDES which still had lift access to vehicle deck.

Later sold to Mira Shipping of Malta and renamed TAMIRA.  She was sold immediately to Euch Zammit & Son of Malta and renamed AL HUSSEIN until 1986 when the vessel was renamed AL RASHEED, same owners who put the vessel up for scrapping in 2010.

Owner: Richard Connon & Co. Aberdeen

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 26/12/1877:
Barque Cleopatra, which was the last vessel built by Messers Humphrey & Co, Aberdeen, left this port for London in charge of Captain F.G. Milne.  She belongs to Messers Richard Connon & Co, Aberdeen.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 30/03/1878:
According to a telegram from Lloyd's agent in Pernambuco, the new Barque Cleopatra, which left London towards the middle of February with general cargo for Port Philip, has gone ashore at Ponta Pedras, the eastermost point of Brazil and has become a wreck.  It is expected that part of her cargo will be recovered.  Later telegram states crew were saved and recovering cargo. 

Daily News, 27/04/1878:
12 of crew of Barque Cleopatra landed in Liverpool.  Barque went ashore near Pernambuco, she afterwards capsized and crew narrowly escaped.  About 60 natives armed with knives boarded the stranded vessel, plundered cargo and robbed crew, whom they threatened. 

Aberdeen Weekly Journal 25/08/1878:
Papers from naval courts held at Pernambuco re loss of Cleopatra have been issued.  On 6 April Mr Walker, British Consul, reported the wreck to board of trade - after wrecked natives began to plunder the vessel.  Captain Prothero appeared two days after, saying he had been detained by the natives.  Twice he refused to attend a naval court martial. When officers were sent to apprehend him he barricaded his door and evaded capture for several days.  When finally brought to trial the Captain behaved in a very eccentric manner, snapping his fingers at President of Court Martial.  Finally court found him guilty of neglecting to attend to his work, of delaying to pay off and discharge crew and of contempt of court. Charge of drunkenness was found not proven.  Assessory remarked that during trial he behaved ''as only a man suffering from great mental excitement or monomania would do''.  Court suspended master's certificate for 12 months and imprisoned him until the mail steamer sailed. Board of Trade subsequently returned Master's certificate because of doubts about jurisdiction of Court Martial.

'MV CLUPEA was specifically designed and built as a dedicated Fishery Research Ship to the order of the UK government.

The ship is equipped with a full outfit of fishery and oceanographic handling, sampling equipment, and laboratory facilities.  The ship's outfit has been augmented and modernised continuously since build.

The ship is operated under a turnkey management arrangement by Marr as a fully integrated fleet unit.  The ship provides at-sea research and survey support to the activities of the Marine Laboratory, Aberdeen.' (Marr Vessel Management Ltd.)

Management passed to private operators in 1991.

Marine Scotland; MV Clupea changes course from Research to Rescue, by Lyndsay Cruickshank:
""Marine Scotland's former research vessel Clupea has recently found a new vocation turning from research cruises to rescue missions. Now known as Sea-Watch 2, the MV Clupea underwent some major refit works in Hamburg, including the addition of a medical ward, to allow it to operate all year round and under bad weather conditions, when, unfortunately, many maritime accidents happen.

Financed by crowd-funding donations, the non-profit, non-government organisation (NGO) Sea Watch was able to buy the ship for their search and rescue (SAR) missions, leaving only weeks ago to take up rescue operations off the Libyan coast.

My Clupea was built in 1968 as a dedicated fishery research ship by order of the UK government then later sold to private operators in 2008.

We are delighted that a vessel we had commissioned has gone on to do such noble work - all the best Sea-Watch 2, you have made us proud.""

Aberdeen Journal, 03/07/1850: 
Thurso, 25 June (From Northern Ensign) Wednesday evening last the splendid Conqueror, of Aberdeen, bound for Calcutta, came to anchor in our bay.  While she filled water casks she was visited by a party of gentlemen, who sailed round the ship admiring the exterior, which presented the most remarkable improvements now being made in naval architecture. Her commander Mr Rennie, very heartily welcomed us aboard and showed us to the cabins.  We were struck with the grandeur and elegance with which they were fitted up, being composed of solid mahogany, beautifully carved with rich gilt moutings. Ceiling was decorated with pictures of heroes of past and present, Wellington, of course pre-eminent Captaine Rennie dsecribed as ''the most gentlemanly, well informed, agreeable and unassuming person who ever trod a quarter deck''. Cargo valued at £50,000. Ship ''the finest example of a clipper built ship ever launched on the east of Scotland''.

CONQUEROR was one of many stern freezer factory trawlers built by Hall Russell's for Hull & Grimsby owners in the 1960s to fish the distant waters of Greenland and Newfoundland for code which mainly were for Birds Eye and other fish factories.

CONQUEROR'S hull is identical to SIR FRED and LADY PARKES also built by Hall Russell.  The only difference was three extra frames were added to midships making CONQUEROR 4' longer.  The bows on these ships were redesigned during early construction as during model testing water was coming over the bow resulting in the new top design being wider and 18 inches higher, being named 'Tulip Bow'.

When the fish was caught it was put into large freezer units on the factory deck then dispatched to the large freezer hold.  Fishing trips were roughly 2-3 months.  A unique addition to these ships was a sealed, watertight, pipe with a search light mounted on the bow under the fore deck.  

Ran aground in a severe winter storm (assumed heavy list to star on the rocks then slipped back in to deeper water) at Newlyn, 0.25 miles from Penzance Point, South Cornwall, 27 December 1977. The wreck was sold to Eurosalve Ltd and was declared a total loss on 30 January 1978. Nothing of wreck visible above water."

Some records state it was this ship that captured and sunk the German submarine UB85 in 1917.  There is a myth that the night before the UB85 had an encounter with a 'sea monster', which is why the submarine surrendered.  However it is not clear whether  was  this drifter or HMS ""Coreopsis"" (I), a Q-ship, which captured and sunk UB85.

Although the anchor was immediately dropped, she drifted upon stones of point of North Pier and soon afterwards sank, all crew except one man saved. Exertions being made to raise vessel.

Caledonian Mercury, 29/11/1828:
After being brought nearer the shore by capstans on the pier, Corsair was cast upon the beach with a heavy swell. it was found the bottom was out and vessel otherwise so much damaged as to be unfit for repair. Body of seaman (McLeod) belonging to her was cast ashore near the wreck next day in a very mangled state and delivered to his friends for interment.

Aberdeen Journal, 6 August 1862:
""Launch of the ""COULNAKYLE"" - On Wednesday the ""COULNAKYLE"", a fine Clipper ship, was launched from the building-yard of Messrs. A. Hall & Co.  The vessel has been built for Mr. John Jamieson, shipowner, Marishal Street.  She is 732 tons builders' measurement, and 611 tons per register.  The principal dimensions are - length 168ft, breadth of beam 35ft; and depth of hold 18ft.

The ""COULNAKYLE"" is classed 13 years A1 at Lloyds; and it is enough to say she is of the best materials, and one of the finest models the Messrs Hall have yet turned out.  The figure-head, it may be stated, is a brawny Highlander, executed with remarkable spirit, in the picturesque ""Garb of old Gaul"".  The ""COULNAKYLE"" is intended for the China trade, and will be commanded by a townsman, Captain Morrison, formerly of the ""AURORA"".  The ceremony of christening was gracefully performed by Miss Jamieson, daughter of the owner, and the vessel glided into the water beautifully, amid the hearty and repeated cheers of a large assemblage.  After the launch, a party of sixty to seventy ladies and gentlemen, friends of the builders and owner sat down in one of the large lofts over the Messrs Hall's workshops, to an elegantly laid out champage banquet.  Mr. Jamieson occupied the chair, and Mr. Hall was Croupier.  Without attempting to report the speeches, which were brief, seldom witty, and always very much to the point, we may enumerate the leading toasts.  ""Success to the COULNAKYLE"".  Proposed by the Croupier, was drunk to with enthusiasm, as was the health of the builders, and the health of Captain Morrison, which followed, called forth a very hearty response.  Captain Morrison, in reply, expressed his firm belief that the""COULNAKYLE""  would add another laurel to the well earned fame of her builders, and would prove one of the finest and fastest ships afloat (Cheers).  He gave the ""Owners"", which was drunk to amid loud cheers, and acknowledged by the Chairman.  After several other toasts the Croupier next gave ""Mr. Wallis, Lloyds Surveyor"".  Mr. Wallis in reply, said, since his presence at the pleasing entertainment had been discovered, he might just say he had witnessed the proceedings of the launch with very great pleasure.  There had been a good head said to-day about the ""COULNAKYLE"" being a splendid ship.  He had little to say in addition, but simply that the ship, while not better than a ship ought to be, was as good as she ought to be - which just meant that better she could not be.  (Loud cheers) As Lloyds surveyor of British and foreign shipping, he had a very great pleasure in testifying to the highly satisfactory way in which the Messrs Hall's work was done.  The vessel had been built under his special survey from the very day that her keel was laid down, and everything had gone on in a way which he was satisfied would do credit to the Messrs Hall, and no less give satisfaction to the owners (Cheers).

After a cup of ""Bon-Accord"" the party an exceedingly pleasant one, broke up.  We may add that Messrs Hall & Co have present upon the stocks three new wooden vessels of high class, representing a tonnage of about 1700; besides another vessel with iron frame and wooden planking - the first of this description built in Aberdeen - the tonnage of which will be from 900 to 1,000 tons, which will be classed for 15 years A1 at Lloyds"".

Water police court - Aaron Fraser, Henry Williams, Peter Swarrey, Christian Petersen, Edward Edwards, Andrew Morrison and William Clarke, seamen on British ship Coulnakyle, were convicted of disobedience of lawful commands, it seems they had refused to turn to work on ground there were not sufficient hands on the vessel.  Hard labour for 4 weeks.

Sydney Morning Herald, 20/02/1867:
Reporting Thames Police court - Captain A Morrison, Master of ship Coulnakyle (owned by Messers Johnson & Co, Aberdeen) appeared to answer 2 summonses. 
Albert Tyler - shipped in Sydney for 2.10.0 per month, which was reduced to 7 shillings per month for incompetency.  He had been reduce to ordinary Seaman two days after sailing on the grounds he could not steer well. Magistrate ruled Master cound have known little of seaman's abilities in two days and it looked like an unjustified attempt to reduce a seaman's wages to please the owners. 
Tom Cherir - shipped as Able Seaman at 3.10.0 a month, but reduced to 2.10.0.  Captain and mate gave evidence that he did not know the mark and deeps on the lead line in Shanghai river and could only take the helm in fine weather. 

Aberdeen Journal, 13/05/1868:
Coulnakyle, from London for AMoy, Spoked, 11 MArch 33S, 24W (Mid Atlantic on latitude of Montevideo and Cape Town).

Hobart Mercury, 29/11/1873:
San Francisco 27 August - Sailor went to shipping office on Battery Street and stated that he desired a ship, but only an English one. Coulnakyle was lying in the stream awaiting a crew and the man, proving on examination to be a good seaman, was at once shipped.  His strange conduct attracted officer's attention - sullen, melancholy and continually muttering to himself, when Captain Japp was ashore to clear the vessel at Custom House, the sailor told 2nd mate that six years ago he and two others have killed a man in New York.  Captain Japp reported this at the Police office and officers boarded the ship and took him ashore. 

Sydney Morning Herald, 19/01/1888:

Auctioned at Birkenhead in 1879, sold to William Thomas of Amlwch for £1800.  Employed in carrying coal to the east and rice home.  Vessel went missing on the return passage of its third voyage.  Sailing with nearly 950 tons of bagged rice from Rangoon on May 26 1882, bound to the channel for orders, vessel put in at St Helena for water and provisions.  COUNTESS OF KINTORE sailed on August 15 to be spoken by the Earl of Dalhousie a month later in 33N 37W before going missing with a crew of 17.  The Court of Enquiry felt it had foundered during bad weather which caused considerable damage to the Earl of Dalhousie shortly after they had spoken on September 15.  A contributory factor, it was felt, was that it was too deeply laden.  Its freeboard when owned by John Cook was 4ft 9 in giving a capacity of 860 tons; after sale it was reduced to 3ft 7in to load 1000 tons, and with the cargo on board at the time of the loss it would have been 4 ft.  These two reduced freeboards were felt to be insufficient for a clipper so sharp."

Wrecked 21 March 1855, Pratas Shoal

From David R. MacGregor 'Tea Clippers - Their History 1833-1875':
Countess of Seafield, 1848
'One of three clippers built at Aberdeen in this year, she helped materially to give Aberdeen a good name in shipping circles. Alexander Duthie launched her in April for Henry Adamson of Aberdeen who, later, owned a number of tea clippers. The Lloyd's Register surveyor wrote in his report:- 'Has a raised quarter deck 3 feet in height. Clipper Bow as termed carried to an extreme in outreach and full length figurehead'. She had a 22 foot longboat and three other boats, and also a windlass, winch and capstan. Rigged as a ship she measured 140.2ft x 25.0ft x 18.2ft. 520 old tons and 451 new tons.  Her short life, spent entirely in the China trade came to an end on 21 March 1855 when she stranded on the Pratas Shoal, China Sea - off Hong Kong. She was refloated and later sold to Cantonese owners'.

6 February 1855: COUNTESS OF SEAFIELD, Capt. Innes at Shanghai from London.

Aberdeen Journal, 22 January 1851:
'We have just learned of another voyage made by an Aberdeen-built ship, which at all events equals if it does not surpass that of this same celebrated ""Oriental"" [an American ship].  
The ""Countess of Seafield,"" built by an Aberdeen firm...Duthie...The ""Countess of Seafield,"" which belong to our enterprising townsman, Baillie Adamson, registers 520 tons, and brings a cargo of over 700 tons of tea and silk.'  
'The Countess gives the following report:
October 8, 1850 - Sailed from Woosung in company with the Blondel, bound to London
October 18, - Spoke the Reliance, from Shanghai to New York, out 13 days, off Pulo Sapata.

Dec. 18. - Watered at St. Helena, and left same day in company with the Coromandel of Aberdeen, and Ben Lomond of Glasgow.
January 19, 1851 - Lay to in the Downs
- It will be seen in the above that the Countess has made the passage from St Helena to the Downs in thirty-two days - the shortest time, we believe, in which the run has ever been accomplished.'

Aberdeen Journal, 6 June 1855:
Another tea laden vessel has been lost on the Pratas Shoal, the COUNTESS OF SEAFIELD, Captain Innes, which left Shanghai for London on the 17th March, struck off the shoal on the 21st. The Captain and part of the crew arrived here (Canton?) on the 7th April? having been picked up outside by the American ship Challenge. The remainder of the crew are on the shoal and a steamer has been sent down to them.

The Morning Chronicle, 2 July 1855:
The ship COUNTESS OF SEAFIELD which was wrecked on the Pratas Shoal has been got off and towed to Whampoa with a large portion of her cargo on board. Considerable quantities of tea have also been brought from the wrecks of other vessels of the shoal.

The Morning Chronicle, 7 July 1855:
The COUNTESS OF SEAFIELD, wrecked on the Pratas, has been got off in tow of the Ann steamer; the Ann was chartered by people in Hong Kong to save the cargo, and, if possible, the ship. The second mate of the Ann was left on board the Countess of Seafield, whilst the steamer brought part of the cargo, 3000 chests of tea, to Whampoa, with orders to keep heaving to an anchor laid out in deep water, when, lo! the ship floated on the return of the Ann. White, the second mate, claimed the salvage, but offered 12,000 dollars to tow the ship to Macao; the steamer put her in the mud, and White refuses to pay, as the steamer has not towed her within a mile of the agreement.  The Portuguese Government took charge of the vessel, made a prisoner of White, and the affair is now in the hands of the Attorney-General. The Pratas lie very convenient for getting rid of vessels off the dipthong, or worm-eaten as the Countess was. It is a strange sight to see a vessel lying deserted on the Pratas with royals and studsails set; but such things have been seen. - Morning Chronicle Correspondent."

Wrecked Manila, Philippines, October 1882

Evening Journal (Adelaide), 31/10/1870:
CRAIGENDARROCH, ship, Robert Phillips master, arrived 29 Oct. from London (Aug.

Evening Journal, 15/11/1871:
CRAIGENDARROCH arrived Adelaide 15 Nov. from London 16 Aug.

Evening Journal, 16/10/1872:
CRAIGENDARROCH, James Hughes master, arrived Adelaide 12 Oct. from London 22 July.

South Australian Register, 6/8/1875:
CRAIGENDARROCH arrived Adelaide 5 Aug. from London 12 May after an average passage. Sighted Madeira 9th day out. Cape Verde Islands passed on the Eastern route. NE trades failed in 7 degrees of north latitude, line crossed 12 June. Soon after a SE trade set in, but so unfavourable that the ship was driven towards Brazilian coast. The prime meridian was reached 1 July & course shaped to reach the roaring forties, where heavy seas occasionally broke aboard as ship scudded before the gales. For 4 weeks decks were never dry & it was a relief to sight Cape Borde.
The crew on joining the vessel in the docks were obstreperous & on getting to sea one of the hands objected to his daily tasks. Logbook states that H. Johnson, a tar, made life rather lively for a few days. When spoken to about his inferior steering, he said he was doing his best & if master wanted ship steered better he must send someone else. Another man was sent to relieve Johnson, who was then requested to go aloft & grease down the mast as a pleasant change. Johnson objected and was ordered forward, but subsequently sent aft & locked in a cabin and fed for a week on bread and water. At the end of that time he refused to work. Master thought Johnson was not in his right senses. On 15 July there was another row because Johnson & another seaman refused to assist in reefing the mainsail. Johnson was found in bed & said he was sick. On 26 July when on the wheel he was told not to run her off & then gave the chief officer insolence. On 27 and 28 July he was laid up with a sore arm. He was ordered off the deck into the forecastle, but refused to go below before he could sniff fresh air. Master then told him he was so incorrigible that he must flog him. At noon all hands were called aft to witness the punishment. No reason has been shown for the revival aboard a merchant ship of the Barbarous custom, which should have no place amongst free men, even if they are seamen.

Express & Telegraph (Adelaide), 11/8/1875:
Searching investigation should be made by the authorities. Captain Hughes ought not to be allowed to go unpunished. (Johnson has also been sentenced by port magistrate to 4 weeks hard labour).

Southern Argus (South Australia), 26/8/1875:
Critics have created a mighty fuss & argued Johnson should have been put in irons to be dealt with by a magistrate. However, he might have spread insubordination among the crew, leaving the ship short handed to the danger of lives and property.

Express & Telegraph, 25/7/1878:
Police Court, port Adelaide, 24 July - Josiah Sampkin, steward of CRAIGENDARROCH, charged on information of customs surveyor of illegal removal of 2 gallons whisky 23 July. He plead guilty and was remanded as case would be heard against Capt. Ramsay that day.

Porder Watch (South Australia), 31/7/1878:
Adelaide, 27 July - a second charge of smuggling was found proved against Capt. Ramsay, fined £25.

Belfast Newsletter, 13/01/1882:
Auction of 2000 fine boards, battens, rafters, firewood, etc., the above of best quality and has just arrived Belfast ex ship CRAIGENDARROCH from Baltimore.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 11/01/1883:
Letter from an Aberdeen Captain writing from Hong Kong Dec. 2 - ""when the cholera in Manila was beginning to decline (having caused 26,000 deaths) there came along a hurricane which laid the whole city in ruin.  We had 13 ships ashore, one an old Aberdeen ship, the CRAIGENDARROCH, which came to complete grief, being swept clean fore and aft.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 20/9/1918:
Concrete Shipbuilding - The last summer excursion for the present season of the members of the Aberdeen Mechanical Society was held on Saturday afternoon, when a visit to the yard of the Aberdeen Concrete Shipping Company Ltd., at South Esplanade East, proved most interesting. The building of reinforced concrete vessels is a subject which has been attracting much attention in these times of national emergency. One of the chief advantages of the use of concrete in the building of ships is that unskilled workers can be largely utilised, and that the work does not take away labour from the steel shipbuilders. At the Aberdeen yard, where the company is showing great enterprise there are at present three vessels in course of construction - two 1000 ton dumb barges, for towing purposes, to be used for crucial traffic, and a tug which will be propelled by steam, with engines of 750 horsepower, and which will displace 535 tons. The dimensions of each of the barges are - Length 180ft, bean 31ft 6in, moulded depth 19ft and of the tug - length 125ft, beam 27ft and moulded depth 14ft 6in. Reinforced concrete vessels it may be  mentioned, displace about 40 per cent more than steel vessels of the same deadweight. The steel is only about 42 and a half per cent of that in steel vessels.

Aberdeen Press & Journal, 8/11/1918:
Latest in Concrete Ships - The latest in concrete ships is under construction in a yard at Granton. Instead of the usual 2 and a half to 3 inches there is only a thickness of three quarters of an inch in the shell, but the concrete is said to be so reinforced as to give a strength equivalent to that of half inch steel. The vessel is the first to be constructed according to the specifications of Mr. A. W. Hillard, the patentee, and the builders are the newly-formed Granton Shipbuilding Company. The vessel is a fishing smack, built after the style of a yacht so far as the main outline is concerned. Its length is 38 feet, width 11 feet 9 inches and depth 7 feet 3 inches, and the weight is about 4 and a half tons, being thus as light as a wooden vessel of the same size.
Little over three weeks has been required for the building of the vessel and it is estimated that a large ship could be completed in six or seven weeks, a considerable saving of time being effected in consequence of the fact that mould are dispensed with in the construction. In the building of this new type of ship there is a large saving in material and the patentee anticipates a great demand for vessels built according to his specifications.

Aberdeen Press & Journal, 17/12/1918:
Launch of Concrete Barge - The Aberdeen Concrete Shipbuilding Company, Limited, have all arrangements completed for the launch of the first concrete ship built at Aberdeen, from the yard at South Esplanade East on Saturday afternoon at 3:15. The barge, 180 feet long by 31 feet 6 inches beam and 19 feet in depth, and having a carrying capacity of 1000 tons, has been built to the order of the Admiralty, and will be named the CRETETREE. Her launching displacement is 850 tons. The barge is of reinforced concrete, designed for cross-channel and coastal traffic, and will be fitted with a donkey engine to supply steam for the steering gear and a compound windlass. It may be mentioned that the work of constructing the vessel has given employment to between 200 and 300 men, that a similar barge is already well under way, that four reinforced concrete tugs of 725 indicated h.p. for the Admiralty have been contracted for, and that while Saturday's launch directly from the ways will be the first of its kind in Scotland, so far as a reinforced concrete vessel is concerned, it is likely to be followed within a comparatively short time by many other.

Features of New Industry - The first launch of a concrete vessel at Aberdeen took place on Saturday from the yard of the Aberdeen Concrete Shipbuilding Company, Ltd., South Esplanade East, when a reinforced concrete barge to the order of the Admiralty was successfully launched directly from the ways, the first time in Scotland of such an achievement. The barge is 180 feet long, with a beam of 31 feet 6 inches, and a depth of 19 feet, and will have a carrying capacity of 1000 tons. The barge is designed for cross-channel and coastal traffic, and will carry a crew of six. It will be fitted with a donkey engine to supply steam for the steering gear and a compound windlass. The work of construction has been given employment to between 200 and 300 men. Another barge of the same type is well under way, and the firm has also received contracts to build four reinforced concrete tugs for the Admiralty of 725 indicated horse-power.
Successful Launch - A large company of ladies and gentlemen had been invited to witness the launching ceremony, the naming being performed by Lady Taggart, who was accompanied by Lord Provost Sir James Taggart. As the vessel left the ways she was named CRETETREE. The derivation from concrete and tree, of which the vessel is constructed, is obvious. The CRETETREE took the water in graceful style, amid the hearty cheers of the spectators, thousands of whom lined the Victoria Bridge and the whole extent of Point Law, on the opposite side of the Dee. The barge was afterwards taken in tow by tugboat. Cake and wine were served to the invited guests - Mr James Scott, jun., in the chair. Lord Provost Sir James Taggart proposed ""Success to the Cretetree"" in happy terms. He said he had expected to find a little boat that went up and down canals and also that it would be an impossibility to float it (laughter) but she floated like a duck, and it was a great pleasure to see the vessel taking the water in such a graceful manner. (Applause.) They had expected the barge to be a great deal, in connection, with the war, but they wanted barges for much more industrial and pleasant duties, such as for food, because they were about tired of a ration of half a roast a week and a chicken once in a fortnight. (Laughter.) The first trip ought to be to Norway for a cargo of granite to Aberdeen, because they could not get tonnage to take over stones to keep the men going. They in Aberdeen were most grateful to the Concrete Shipbuilding Company for starting a new industry. They had been losing a lot of industries, and speaking about getting new ones, and this was one of the most important when they were employing about 300 hands. It was a jolly good start, and they would give Mr Scott all the hands they possibly could. There was a lot of women workers in Aberdeen, and they were ""they boys."" (Laughter.)
Future of Concrete Ships - Mr H. A. Flinn, assistant director of reinforced concrete construction at the Admiralty, replied. He said the barge was the fifteenth which had been launched of the same design, and it made the twenty-seventh concrete vessel now floating in these waters. It was barley a year ago since it was first decided to built concrete vessels in this country. One of the conditions was that they had to built these vessels within a certain time, and that they had not been able to do mainly because of the shortage of material and the non-support from labour. From time to time he had been asked as to the future of concrete ships, and his reply had always been, and was today, that it depended on labour. Many thought that concrete ships had been started to compete with steel vessels. That was not the case. Concrete ships were simply to supplement the output owing to the scarcity of material. So far as the Aberdeen yard was concerned, he thought the department which he represented was absolutely satisfied so far as the workmanship was concerned and the cost of the vessel. (Applause) It compared very favourably with some of the deadweight carrying vessels - in fact, it was about 15 per cent, cheaper. (Applause.) Although Aberdeen had not launched the first concrete barge, they really had built this barge, as compared with other concrete shipbuilders, in record time. (Applause.) He found some difficulty at first, in getting contractors to build them, but after he got begun he found they had every confidence in him. They carried on and spent money, laying out yards and building these ships, and had been spending money to that day without a contract. Many of them had not a contract, and he thought the concrete shipbuilders should receive some considerable credit for doing that. (Applause.)
Memento to Lady Taggart. - Mr James Scott, sen., proposed the toast of ""Lady Taggart"", and as a memento of the occasion he presented her, in the name of the shipbuilders, with a gold brooch, for which Lady Taggart returned thanks, and wished the CRETETREE all success. Mr J. B. Nicol, manager of the company, proposed ""The Designers” - Messrs Mouch and Partners, Westminster, and Vickers, Ltd. The lines of the barge were designed without curving the timber in any way, and the vessel from top to bottom was a straight line. Great credit was due to both designers in having constructed the barge in such a manner that both shipbuilders and concrete workers were thoroughly in touch with once another, and so close that they had produced certainly a masterful work in reinforced concrete. (Applause.) Mr A. Hull, of Vickers, Ltd., responded. Mr James Gray, Scottish Concrete Ship Construction Co., Greenock, proposed ""The Builders"", and complimented them on the fine workmanship and successful launch. Mr J. Scott, jun, replied. At any time, he said, it was always difficult to start a new business, but to start it at such a time as they had passed through had certainly been very trying. They were gratified, however, to see that their labours had come to a successful issue, and he hoped they would be able to continue their efforts and push this new industry to good suits. (Applause.) The Lord Provost proposed the health of the chairman, and ""Bon-Accord"" concluded the pleasant proceedings."

Aberdeen Journal, 12/07/1843:
Died at sea of yellow fever, on his passage from St. Domingo to Falmouth on 1st June Mr Alexander Martin, Commander of the barque CRUSADER of this port, in 39th year.  Exemplary in every relation of life, active and upright in the performance of his duties, Captain Martin was much esteemed by those who knew him and his premature death is deeply deplored by relatives and friends.

The Era (London), 04/05/1845:
Inquest on body of Thomas Forbes, age 20.  Deceased was seaman on board barque CRUSADER, now lying in St. Katherine's Docks.  As the vessel was passing North Foreland the deceased was ordered to the masthead to unfurl the topsail, the gasket he had hold of broke and he fell head first onto the deck and fractured his skull, from which injury he expired a few minutes afterwards.  Verdict - accidental death.

Freeman's Journal, 05/11/1860:
Advices from Buenos Ayres state that a terrific gale occurred on La Plata during 29-30 August, creating widespread destruction.  The British barques CRUSADER and RECIPROCITY came into contact and sunk each other.  The Captain and Mate of the CRUSADER were drowned and part of the crews of each vessel shared the same fate."

Copy of address presented to Capt. Robert Murray of Aberdeen clipper DAMASCUS, belonging to George Thompson, Jun. & Co:- sense of your judicious, zealous, unwearied attention to safety of ship, especially during unusually arduous passage through the ice over 71 degrees longitude and 6 degrees latitude. You passed 11 whole consecutive nights on deck on watch while by your cheerfulness and energy you gave confidence and courage to us all. Our best thanks to you, your excellent officers and crew. Beg you to accept from us a small purse.

Sydney Morning Herald, 19/12/1861:
Extract of letter from Sir W.W. Barton: - We were 88 days on our passage home, 30 to Cape Horn + for 2200 miles to the Cape were beset by icebergs. Our good captain passed 11 nights consecutively on deck. The cold was extreme. Ladies had to keep to their cabins for a week, but for 2 weeks (missing only 1 day) the children never ceased their play. The icebergs we saw were of a height (one above 170 feet and another 300) + size (like islands) which must have grown over many years. We saw the submerged part of one of these, which was covered with green grass, weed + shellfish. Our captain left at the exact time calculated to have a full moon when in those longitudes, but sleet + mist impeded the moon’s rays. Capt. Murray deserved + received our thankful acknowledgment with a full purse. The ship was abundantly + liberally supplied and we fared as well as on any ship.

gross tonnage: 1777 ton",,"British Electricity Authority, London",,"Yard Number: 819

Owner: British Electricity Authority, London (Manager: Stephenson Clarke Ltd)

Vessel was named by Dame Caroline Haslett (1895-1957).  Caroline Haslett was born at Worth, Sussex in 1895. During the First World War, she joined the Cochran Boiler Company where she acquired a basic engineering training and from that time became something of a pioneer for women in the electrical and professional world.

From 1946-1954 Dame Caroline was the only woman member of the Council of the British Institute of Management and in 1953-1954 Chairman of the British Electrical Development Association, the first time a woman had been appointed to that office. She was also the only woman member of the British Electricity Authority 1947-1956 - a popular appointment in view of the importance of domestic electrical development.  In recognition of her services she was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1931 and in 1947 was promoted to Dame Commander.

1955: Owners now called Central Generating Authority later changed to Central Electricity Generating Board.

1975-81: Described as for general cargo.

1980-83: Described as a cable-layer repair ship and in 1982-83 described as being ""for English Channel Service South of a line Harwich to Hook of Holland"".

Reported as being one of the six fast ships built for the Orient Line and initially used as a tea clipper in the Indian trade.

In 1874, owned by Anderson & Co., of London and sailed to Australia with emigrants.

In 1879 she was used to carry coal between Australia and America, returning with a load of timber.

In 1887 sold to new owners and used as an emigrant ship between England and Australia.

In 1899, gutted by fire in Sydney Harbour. The ship was then purchased by the Westport Coal Company and taken to Dunedin where refitted before being towed to Lyttelton and put into service as a coal hulk.  The DARRA served steamers in the port of Lyttelton for over 50 years.  During this period, a community of hulk-keepers lived aboard with their wives and children.  Circa 1910 J P Barnes was keeper of DARRA, the last of the hulks and once among the fastest and finest of the Orient Company's fleet.  Barnes with his wife and three girls, lived in roomy, comfortable quarters and in the big, well proportioned and beautifully panelled saloon, which was their living room, entertained various guests.

On 16 December 1950, DARRA was spruced up and fully rigged to represent the emigrant ship Charlotte Jane for the Canterbury Centennial celebrations.  Once the celebrations had been completed, the DARRA was dismantled, cut down and sold as scrap.

In 1951, DARRA was beached at Quail Island, in Lyttelton harbour.  In April 1953 an attempt was made to destroy the vessel by the New Zealand army, who attempted to blow her up.  The only damage sustained was a blown out portion of one side.  Vessel is still there.

Description of narrow escape of fine ship DARRA in cyclone from Cape Argus, 20 January:- arrived Table Bay 18 Jan. after fine passage of 59 days from Adelaide with cargo for London of 436 ingots silver, 7631 ingots copper, 3269 bags copper ore, 3920 bales and 29 packages wool, 1 pipe and 6 cases wine, 25 tons bark, 50 kegs preserved meat, 483 casks tallow, 13 bales leather and 9 passengers. Capt. Lodwick reports cyclone experienced 17 December 26.20S, 78E [Southern Ocean]. With barometer falling fast shortened sail and set hands to making everything secure.  Fore and main topsails blew away into the clouds. Terrific gusts of wind. Lee main deck under water. Lee boat, hanging under water, was cut away so as not to injure ship. Appeared danger of everything being blown away. Sea made clean breach over ship fore and aft, washing everything moveable from decks, including most of livestock. In vortex of cyclone wind died away, but sea was tremendous, tumbling over ship, washing right through saloon and cabins. Ship then put under bare poles and allowed to drift. She behaved herself nobly in the sea and, had she not been strongly built, she must have gone down as at times sea was something frightful to look at as it rolled down upon the ship.

Press and Journal, 31/3/1904:
The Early Days on Trawling at Aberdeen. In view of the launch today of the S. S. Choice from the yard of Mr John Duthie at Torry, it may be of interest to say that we have had an opportunity of seeing a written copy of an offer which was made by Baille Meff's father to the owners of the vessel DEACON, which was launched in 1870 from almost the same place as is now occupied by Mr Duthie's yard. The offer shows that Mr Meff was prepared to hire the DEACON at the sum of £3 per week, keep her in through repair, fit her with a 40 feet trawl and warp and other requirements for trawl fishing. The offer was not accepted on behalf of the owners of the DEACON. The document in question further bears that some of the catchers of the DEACON, which trawled between Aberdeen and Newburgh in 1871-72, were as follows: February, 1871 - Flukes £8 16s, turbot £1 7s; March - Flukes and turbot, £20; April - Flukes and turbot £15. The vessel discontinued fishing because although a large quantity of turbot was caught, there was no sale for it except in the hotels in Aberdeen, and the supply greatly exceeded the demand. It is needless to say that present day figures show that the trawling industry has developed enormously since the days of the DEACON. It may be mentioned that as far back as the year 1590 trawling was commenced at Greyhope."

His instructions to the chief officer when he left the bridge were insufficient. The chief officer was not justified in altering course without calling the master.

DEESIDE was one of John Lewis' pocket class trawlers built for W. G. Wilson & S. F. Robertson (Portknockie, Banff).

DEESIDE was different from the other pocket class trawlers as DEESIDE could fish from port or starboard sides and the other pocket trawlers only fished from the port side. The stern quarter was covered in to allow for extra crew accommodation.

DEESIDE was sold in 1981 to James Robertson, Portknockie, name still DEESIDE, Fishing Number now BF374. 

She was then sold to James Buchan & John Baird, Peterhead and renamed STRATHGARRY PD91. Possibly under James Buchan/John Baird ownerwhip she was converted from trawling to seine neeting with 3/4 shelterdeck added and all trawl fishing gear removed.

1878-9: Master R. Crombie.

Larn, Shipwreck Register of British Isles, Vol. 4:
20/03/1879: Firth of Forth, Isle of May, voyage Leith-Aberdeen. Cargo bagged flour. Capt. Crombie in haze and after being confused by lights of other ships struck rocks on N.W. of May Island shortly after 3.00am. Managed to back off rocks, but found forehead filling rapidly. 4.30am fell over on her port side, was abandoned and sank.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 8/6/1878:
Friday night last Aberdeen steamer DENMORE, Capt. Crombie, arrived at Dundee under tow. She was on voyage Aberdeen - Amble (Northumberland), and was near Bell Rock when a portion of her machinery broke down. She was picked up by Dundee tug FLYING SCOTSMAN and towed to Dundee, where repairs will be carried out. Her owners Nicol & Co., of Aberdeen, summoned a tug by telegram to the Dundee harbour master, but FLYING SCOTSMAN was already in the area.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 21/3/1879:
Steamer DENMORE, Capt. R. Crombie, left Leith shortly before midnight on Wednesday for Aberdeen with a valuable cargo of flour. Weather was clear at time of sailing, but dense fog subsequently fell down and great caution had to be exercised in navigating as it was impossible to see any distance ahead. She proceeded slowly on her course until 3 in the morning, when she suddenly struck on the May Island. Engines were immediately reversed and after a short time she got clear of the rocks. It was then discovered that a large hole had been made in starboard bow and water gained so rapidly that forepart of steamer began to sink. Capt. Crombie immediately ordered engines to be put on at full speed in hope of being able to reach the land, strenuous efforts being made to keep water under by means of pumping. However, forepart sank deeper and propeller was lifted almost out of the water and tags made useless. Part of the crew now took to the boats and kept alongside, 5 being left aboard. About 5a.m., when DENMORE was nearly 3 miles off May Island and fast sinking, the whole of the crew being now in their 2 boats, the Dundee and Liverpool steamer PRINCESS ALICE came in sight. Capt. Crombie asked master of PRINCESS ALICE to take DENMORE in tow, but Capt. Kerr declined to make fast as it was evident she was sinking. 10 minutes later DENMORE heeled over on her port side and sank in 29 fathoms. The crew, 12 in number, with their boats, were taken aboard PRINCESS ALICE and landed at Dundee. With one exception they all belonged to Aberdeen - Capt. R. Crombie; William Duncan (mate); John Bruce (boatswain); William Gavin (carpenter); Robert Petrie (steward); Thomas Henderson (AB); John Bruce (ordinary seaman); Robert Sturrock (chief engineer); James Bruce (2nd engineer); Thomas Fraser (fireman) and two other firemen. The steamer, owned by A. Nicol & co., was only partly insured. The cargo of flour from Leith Flour Mills, worth between £4000 and £5000, we understand is covered by insurance.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 8/4/1879:
Board of trade inquiry into loss of steamer DENMORE was held in Aberdeen yesterday before Mr. H.C. Rothery, H.M. Wreck Commissioner. Court held that the master, Robert Crombie, had been guilty of neglect of duty and want of caution in proceeding at full speed while he was not sure of his position owing to the haze which prevailed at the time. His certificate was suspended for 3 months, but in consequence of the truthful manner in which he had given his evidence, it was recommended he be given a 1st mate's certificate until his own be returned. He was not ordered to pay costs."

Melbourne Argus, 12/04/1867: 
Clipper ship DEVANHA, of the Aberdeen Line, arrived in the bay Wednesday morning and was yesterday morning berthed at the Victorian Railway Pier, Williamstown [Near Melbourne]. DEVANHA is a handsome little vessel - a real clipper of around 700 tons, and was constructed especially for the China tea trade, in which she has made some good passages. Her present voyage, however, has been unduly protracted, but this cannot be wondered at much, seeing she is not in flying trim but, on the contrary, has brought a most enormous cargo for her tonnage and, moreover, has had to contend against much adverse weather on her way out. She has come into port scrupulously clean, and her smart appearance below and aloft indicates that she is ably officered and efficiently manned. Captain Thomson informs us that he left London on Jan. 1st and met with strong W and SW winds in the channel and when about a week out the ship was caught in a fearfully heavy gale from the SW, which lasted about 24 hours. Very unsettled weather prevailed until falling in with the NE trades (which were light) in Lat 23N [off West Africa]. Equator was crossed on February 3rd. The SE trades were very light and inconsistent and alternated with light variable winds until making Gough's Island on Feb 21st. Light winds and foggy weather prevailed from thence to the Meridian of the Cape of Good Hope, which was passed on March 3rd in 42 degrees south. Winds between 30th and 45th degrees of east longditude were chiefly from the NE and were accompanied with disagreeable dirty weather from 45 degrees east stong westerly winds prevailed and from 1st April until taking the pilot aboard nothing but easterly weather was experienced. On March 15th during a gale the two maintopmast backstay chain plates were carried away.

2 decks, Ice Class 2, welded

Built for the National Oceanographic Council, DISCOVERY was the largest general purpose oceanographic research vessel in use in the United Kingdom and is still in use today.

Launched 3rd July 1962 by Viscountess Hailsham, wife of the Minister for Science.

3 oil engines 4SA each 6 cyl 12

DISCOVERY was built as an Ocean Research Vessel to explore the oceans around the world.  Her superstructure and funnel - built from aluminium to reduce the weight - were fixed by using aluminium rivets and welding - the only time this has been done on a ship in Hall Russells.  DISCOVERY had a number of laboratories installed on board which were modified along with new computers when she came back for a refit in the later sixties early seventies.

When built, work spaces included well-equipped, fully air-conditioned scientific laboratories; biological, chemical, bacteriological, hydro deck, after rough, photographic and low temperature laboratories with electronic laboratory and workshop.  There was also a scientific workshop, net room, scientific cinema and library.  

Today, fitted with a broad range of oceanographic equipment, DISCOVERY can also accommodate containerised laboratories, with berths available for 28 scientific staff, and has the ability to spend up to 45 days at sea. Her last major overhaul was in 1991/1992, when a new superstructure and power plant were installed and her hull lengthened by 10 metres.  She was lengthened to 90.05 meters and cranes were installed - 1 x 130 ton, 1 x 75 ton, 3 x 30 ton; Two A-Frames - 1 x 20T and 1 x 15T; 7 diesel electric engines driving 2 gen each 1,058KW 415AC 2 gen each 704W A15 AC connected to electric motor driving 1 Fixed Pitch propeller.

The owners name changed to N.E.R.C. Research Ship Unit (National Enviro Research Council), London, UK.

Scrapped, Belgium, 2013:
After 51 years service with National Environment Research Council, that has seen the ship being transformed in different phases throughout its 51 years with the superstructure removed and rebuilt, new engines installed and lengthened by 20ft as to what it was when she left the shipyard in 1962, to finally in 2013 when she was taken to Gallo Recycle Yard, Ghwent, Belgium.  Her name is carried on by the National Environment who have built a new ship, built in Spain and commissioned in 2013 to replace DISCOVERY.


The Burntisland Group Journal, Vol. 27, No.2 (page 58):
The DISCOVERY's First Task

'The royal research ship DISCOVERY completed by Hall, Russell & Co. Ltd. in 1962 is to take part in the International Indian Ocean Expedition for about fifteen months in 1963 and 1964 and will play a leading part in surveying the Arabian Sea. 

'The Arabian Sea is of particular interest to scientists for in the course of a year there is a complete reversal of direction of the wind and by studying the response of the water movements to this change much should be learnt about the mechanism of wind driven currents.

'The movement of currents is studied both by following the salt content of the water and its density and a principle feature of the ship's work will be the collection and analysis of water samples from different depths in the Ocean.  At the same time, direct measurements of currents will be made with current meters and by following neutrally buoyant floats which are weighted to float at a chosen depth where they drift along with the current emitting a sound signal which can readily be tracked with hydrophones on the ship. 

'The Indian Ocean is also surrounded by countries which are both badly undernourished and yet have rapidly growing populations and there is a great need to find and develop mew fisheries which can provide food for these people.  There are already indications that the Arabian Sea is an exceptionally fertile area and so the DISCOVERY will devote a large part of her time to making measurements of the fertility in different areas and to finding out where the fish are most likely to be caught.  To do this, the plants and animals of the plankton from the surface to the bottom of the ocean will be studied and large underwater trawls will be used to catch fish in the depths of the sea.  DISCOVERY will also be fitted with a special high frequency, narrow beam echo-sounder to detect and examine fish shoals in mid-water.

'The shape of the sea bed will also be charted by continuous echo sounding with a precision of about one fathom in three thousand so that even the smallest slopes on the sea floor can be detected, while seismic and magnetic techniques will be used to learn more about the geological history of the Arabian Sea and to try to understand why, for example, the Seychelles Islands are made of granite, a most unusual feature of the oceanic islands.

'These studies of the Indian Ocean will be but a prelude to the career of DISCOVERY and we feel confident that she will set an example in exploration of the seas as fine as that of her predecessors.'

Since Wednesday a large body of workmen had been employed in giving the ways a fresh coating of grease and, immediately on the supports being removed yesterday, the vessel glided smoothly into the water. Cheers were raised by the onlookers. Cake and wine was served to a company of ladies & gentlemen, when ""Success to the Don"" and other toasts were pledged. The DON, which is a finely modelled vessel, is the 4th steamer launched from Duthies' yard since June.

In 1914 the Hartlepool Trawler DORIS BURTON and her crew of six Scarborough men, was believed to have sunk after hitting a mine in the North sea. The six men were; J.W. Truefitt, skipper, leaving a wife and 4 children, Absalom Cave, 47, Mate, leaving wife and 9 children, Robert Jowsey, 30, unmarried, Wm. Reynolds, wife and 4 children, Thomas Leslie Harwood, 17, Cook, John Christopher Mansfield, 18.

Two reports of this incident, one from the Scarborough Weekly Post, 24 Dec 1914, which reports the loss of the DORIS BURTON, lists her crew, and is believed to ""have been sacrificed to German mines"", and another report from the Scarborough Pictorial, 16 Dec 1914, which tells of the tragedy and gives a little insight into the people on board. Not recorded as a fishing vessel lost at sea due to war.

Glasgow Herald, 13/01/1872:
Captain Walker of the ship DOROTHY from Antwerp for Greenock (sugar) reported that, when about 30 miles ENE of Portland last night a strange barque ran into her, striking her amidships, carrying away rail, bulwarks, stanchions, tearing new mainsail to ribbons.  Owing to the darkness fo the night could make nothing of the other vessel.  Finding the vessel making no water, bore up for Portland Roads.

Glasgow Herald, 13/04/1872:
Aitken, Lilburn & Co.'s Line of clipper packets to Australia - from Glasgow for Sydney.  The splendid Aberdeen-built clipper ship DOROTHY, 760 tons register, A1 at Lloyds and newly metalled.  This fine vessel sails very fast and has just received a most extensive overhaul, having been put in every part into first rate order.

Western Mail (Cardiff), 02/01/1873:
Newport - James Powell and 7 other sailors were charged with refusing to proceed to sea in the ship DOROTHY of Glasgow.  Complainant (Capt. John Andrew Gordon) said prisoners signed articles to sail to Kingston, Jamaica.  They subsequently refused to proceed to sea, alleging the ship was unseaworthy.  Surveyor Mr. Wilmot said he would not have liked to go to sea in the ship before he surveyed her.  Case dismissed.

Western Mail, 08/01/1880:
Report from David Wright, master of ship ""DOROTHY"" of Liverpool, owned by Robet Walter Jamieson, Greenock, which sailed from Liverpool with coals for Montevideo on 23 December on 26th in Lat. 51-17N, Long. 7-15W...she was struck during a fearful squall, accompanied with thunder and lightning and was laid on her beam ends.  The deck rapidly filled with water and her sails were blown from the bolt-ropes.  A ball of fire had struck the foretopmast.  The concussion was sharp, sparks of fire flying from the mast in every direction.  The ship was making a great deal of water and, when all available hands were set to work the pumps, they were found to be partially choked with coal.  The captain decided to bear up for the Bristol Channel and arrived safely in Penarth Roads."

Dundee Courier, 15/2/1866:
Screw steamer DOUGLAS, just finished for Captain R. E. Baker by Messrs Hall Russell & Co. and intended for trading in the China seas, was on Tuesday put on her final trail trip. She is propelled by 2 direct acting inverted engines of effective horsepower 700. Vessel left our docks at 10:30am under the special command of Captain Campbell, harbour master, having on board several nautical gentlemen, including Captain Baker, Captains Duthie, Urquhart and Main, Mr. J.C. Couper, Mr William Hall, Mr Russell, engineer, etc. She proceeded to sea, where a heavy groundswell awaited her, through which she passed in gallant style, not only proving the efficiency of the engines, but also the capabilities of the ship as a sea boat. The vessel's head was turned northwards to the bottom of our bay & on coming south she ran the measured mile in 4 mins. 25 sec., an average of 12 and 1/2 knots an hour. On going south of the harbour, and on returning along the land, speed was proved to be 13 knots. Vessel in every respect has been declared to be to entire satisfaction of the owners, and we congratulate the builders on the resuscitation of a branch of business in our quarter which is destined to supersede the more ancient propulsion by sails alone for which, hitherto, they have been favourably known in the nautical world. The internal fittings of the DOUGLAS are unique of their kind, and will amply repay a visit while at the quay here. Her departure direct for Hong Kong is fixed for 20th February and we will watch with anxiety the time she occupies on her voyage to China.

Aberdeen Journal, November 27th 1896:
'Captain Pirie and Steam Line Fishing; an interesting voyage.  
The North of Scotland Fishing Company's steam liner Drumblade, on which Captain Pirie M. P. proceeded to sea on Tuesday afternoon for the purpose of gaining a practical knowledge of this branch of the industry, arrived at Aberdeen yesterday morning.  
The member for North Aberdeen speaks in complimentary terms of the seaman-like manner in which the crew of the steam liner navigated the vessel, and expresses himself highly pleased with the trip.  The Drumblade's catch consisted of 33cwts. of cod, 3cwts. of skate, 1cwt. of ling, and 2cwts. of eels - a total comparing favourably with the shots landed by steam liners yesterday morning.
During the trip, the hon. gentleman made himself most agreeable to the fishermen; and not only did he take the keenest interest in all the operations, but in the manual work he proved himself most useful.  Attired as he was in deep-sea boots, and wearing a large canvas apron, the constituents of North Aberdeen would have experienced some difficulty in recognising their energetic representative in Parliament.
On Tuesday evening, several hours after leaving Aberdeen, Captain Pirie had a not altogether pleasant experience of the risks run by a fisherman while prosecuting his calling.  When the Drumbalde was off Peterhead, on its way to the Moray Firth, a collision took place between the steam liner and a large yawl.
Fortunately, neither vessel sustained damage.
On reaching the fishing ground off Noss Head, the crew of the Drumbalde shot their lines, which covered an area of nearly 10 miles, and in this operation Captain Pirie took an active part.
When the men began to haul in, the hon. gentleman stationed himself at the stern of the vessel, and in a way which would have done credit to the most experienced of fishermen, pulled the ines on board by means of a hook attached to a pole.
He also assisted in the work of releasing the fish from the lines.
It may also be mentioned that Captain Pirie took his turn of watch with the fishermen, slept in their bunks, and took meals with them.
On the arrival of the vessel in port yesterday morning, Captain Pirie, after shaking hands with the fishermen, left for Hilton House carrying with him a splendid specimen of a codfish and a skate.
The member for North Aberdeen is, it is understood, to complete his practical knowledge of fishing by taking a voyage in a yawl.'

'Duburg Launched at Last'
'The 6000-ton cargo ship Duburg, which defined two launching attempts last week from the Aberdeen yard of Hall Russell & Co. Ltd., took to the water without ceremony yesterday.
Said a yard spokesman, "" we took advantage of a favourable opportunity and there was no hitch this time.  Everything went smoothly.  The fact that it was a very mild day probably helped.  The vessel is now at our fitting out berth for the process of completion.""
The effect of low overnight temperatures on the slipway lubricants was blamed for the initial failure of efforts to launch the ship - the first vessel built in Britan for German owners since World War II.'

Lloyd's List for 1839 gives Destined voyage as Aberdeen to Sunderland under Master James Horn. Classified for 8 years and character for hull and stores is A1.

14 April 1839 sailed from Dundee for Riga under Captain Horn.

Vessel lost at sea 25th April 1839 in Gulf of Riga.

Disastrous Shipwrecks, Morning Post (London), 23 May 1839:
'We are sincerely sorry to state that on Friday evening we received information of the disastrous loss of seven ships in the Gulf of Riga on the 25th ult.  Two of these vessels are fine new brigs belonging to the port of Aberdeen, - viz the DUKE OF RICHMOND and the ORLANDO.  The others are the REGINA OF PERTH (also a new brig), the WAVE and the PACIFIC of Montrose, the DEPTFORD of Sunderland and two Dutch brigs. Having been favoured with a perusal of the letters which communicate this disastrous event we are able to state the facts.  Capt. Horn of the DUKE OF RICHMOND gives very full particulars in his letter from Windau. He states that he had a favourable passage out to Domesness, fell in with the ice there on the 21st April and lay there for two days until the wind came from the westward and cleared the ice from the land enabling about 70 sail to proceed.  When this fleet was within about 35 miles from Riga the wind shifted to the South East and set the ice down upon all the ships. Capt. Horn says ""We could not get back and on the 25th April about half past nine o'clock in the morning the ice took our ship and in less than 20 minutes she went down along with six more close to us. The seven vessels were lost within half a mile of each other"".  Capt. Horn adds ""we travelled over the ice to the land, a distance of about six miles and stayed there two days before we proceeded and such travelling I had never encountered"".

Committee of Harbour Board took evidence on condition of barque DUKE OF SUTHERLAND, recenlty wrecked at Timaru.  Her boatswain and 2 apprentices swore vessel was rotten and leaky and crew were afraid to go to sea in her again. It was believed she would never reach England. Purchaser of wreck corroborates this by saying many of principal beams and planks, as well as the sternpost, were like cheese. 1st mate said she was strongly built and knew of nothing the matter with her. Some pieces of timber were produced, which fully supported evidence of her unseaworthiness.

Subsequent Names: BIJOY, F35 (2010)

DUMBARTON CASTLE was one of two ships ordered by the Royal Navy to police the offshore installations of Britain with sister ship LEEDS CASTLE with a helicopter landing base. They were designed as a prototype development for a larger ship to replace the Navy's leander class frigate but failed to advance any further. They were twin screw propelled ships. After being used to police the oil rigs they were deployed to patrol the Falkland Islands after the 1982 Falklands War with 3 month rota trips. This role ended in 2008 and laid up at Portsmouth and sold to the Bangladesh Navy in 2010 and underwent a multi million pound upgrade at A&P Hepburn on the Tyne where the main engines, gearbox and shafts were overhauled and new generators and deck cranes were fitted.  Missile system is proposed to be fitted later on.
BIJOY suffered electrical failure during sea trials and almost drifted into a breakwater near South Shields on 20 October. The lifeboat and tugs rescued the ship and towed it back to the yard for repairs to the power failure. BIJOY and DHALESHWARI F36 sailed for Bangladesh on 22 November 2010.

Article from 'Navy News' April 2005:
Background on HMS Dumbarton Castle:     
Presently on what is likely to be her final tour of duty in one of Britain’s final remants of Empire, HMS Dumbarton Castle is the constant defender of the UK’s interests in the South Atlantic.
The ship arrived in the Falklands last October, taking over from her sister Leeds Castle which was heading north after nearly four years in the South Atlantic.
Although this is possibly the twilight of Dumbarton Castle’s career, the pace of operations has actually picked up as 2005 opened.
The 81-metre ship embarked an entire infantry company (normally there’s space aboard the Castle class ships for about 25 embarked personnel) for Exercise Purple Strike, a combined forces war game around the Falklands.
Embarked personnel is nothing unusual for Dumbarton Castle. On almost every sortie a group of soldiers from the RIC – Roulement Infantry Company – stationed in the Falklands goes to sea and is put ashore in the far-flung corners of the islands, either by sea boat or helicopter.
Working with the sister forces based in the Falklands is integral to the guardship’s duties. Air defence exercises are regularly conducted with the RAF’s F3 Tornado jets as are flying exercises involving air force and civilian helicopters.
The ship also frequently drops in on some of the more remote settlements on the hundreds of islands which make up the Falklands.
The Castle class has taken it in turns to rotate duties around the Falklands – three years in the South Atlantic, three years based in the UK – for the past two decades.
Unique in the small ships fleet, the Castles can accommodate a helicopter up to Sea King size.
That helicopter facility will remain in the successor offshore patrol ship just ordered by the Navy to replace Dumbarton and Leeds Castles (see page 3).
Although the core of Dumbarton Castle’s time is spent around the Falklands, she pays regular visits to the more remote dependency of South Georgia (about twice every three months) and occasional ones to the South Sandwich Islands.
The latter archipelago is about as far south as any warship is permitted to travel – Antarctic waters are off limits to military vessels.
The ship’s company of 50 typically spends six months aboard before returning to the UK.
They are supported by a shore-based team of Royal Navy engineers who ensure the ship is ready for duties.
Today’s Dumbarton Castle is the third British warship to bear the name.
The first was actually a Scottish warship, a sixth-rate frigate which saw action against the French at the beginning of the 18th century. She was added to the RN in 1707 – then captured the following year by the French privateer Le Jersey whilst guarding merchantmen off Waterford.
It was more than two centuries before the name again appeared, this time as a Castle class corvette in the latter stages of WW II.
Launched in Dundee in September 1943, the second Dumbarton Castle was thrown into convoy operations in the North Atlantic until the war’s end.
After a brief spell as a search-and-rescue ship, she was mothballed in 1946 and finally broken up 15 years later.
Today’s bearer of the name was built in Aberdeen and hurtled down the slipway of the Hall Russell yard in June 1981 and was handed over to the RN nine months later.
She and her sister were immediately sent south when the Falklands crisis flared up one month later, earning the ship a second battle honour.
As ‘Falklands guardship’ – as she’s commonly referred to – it is Dumbarton Castle’s duty to protect the islands and the UK’s territorial waters, including fishery stocks, oil and gas installations, to a 200-mile limit. 
Additional tasks include continuing to foster good relations with the islanders, conducting boarding operations of passing ships and boats if needed, and the dispersal of oil slicks should any occur in territorial waters.

'Shipwreck Index of the British Isles' Vol. 4, R. & B. Larn:
19th July 1877
On a voyage from Dundee to Archangel
Cargo - Ballast
Position - Fair Isle, South Harbour, Head o' the Baa, 59.30.40N / 01.38.40W.
Struck the rocks in fog and wind condition E. Force 3. The passenger, the Rev. James Watt of Glasgow, had taken to his bunk being very seasick, and on hearing the noise and commotion of her stranding, thought that she had put into port somewhere.  He therefore ran on deck demanding he be put ashore at once! Local fishermen took off the crew and shortly after she sank in deep water.
The wreck lies very scattered in 20m. depth, her prop shaft and four bladed iron propeller still visible amongst the rocks.
The Captain is named as Patterson.

Dundee Courier, 16/10/1875:
Gravesend, 14 Oct - Steamer DUNCAN, for the North, has put back with her machinery damaged.

Huddersfield Daily Chronicle, 14/4/1876:
Lloyd's telegram states terrible gale raging in the Baltic. Many vessels wrecked - wrongly reported to include DUNCAN, steamer, of and from Dundee for Revel with a general cargo.

Dundee Courier, 24+25/7/1877 & Aberdeen Journal, 26/7/1877:
Vessel left Dundee in ballast for Archangel to load a cargo of tow & codilla, with crew of 13 & one passenger, an English clergyman Mr. Watt. The following morning she was overtaken by thick weather, and while endeavouring to pick her way cautiously, she suddenly struck on a ledge of rock at south end of Fair Isle, sea being comparatively smooth. Ship's 3 boats were immediately launched & 2 kedge anchors were towed in them from the stern seaward to prevent the ship driving further on the rocks. When the anchors were left go, the chains were hauled tight by a steam winch, and the engines reversed at full speed, but the vessel remained fast. Shortly after she struck, about a dozen skiffs belonging to the inhabitants came alongside their occupants, besides helping to tow the anchors seawards, assisted the crew to land their clothing and a quantity of stores, a task accomplished with no small difficulty and danger. The crew, with the boats lying alongside, remained on the steamer until the main deck was covered with water, when they abandoned her and rowed for the island. Next day nothing was seen except her bilge and following day she had disappeared entirely in deep water. The crew were most hospitably entertained by the islanders. Mr. Watt, who was on a holiday tour to Shetland, baptised 8 children on the island. The crew were taken to Lerwick by the steamer ST. MAGNUS. Capt. Patersen remained in Lerwick. The rest of the crew proceeded by ST. MAGNUS to Aberdeen and then most of them by train to Dundee. The mate, William Lawson, who belongs to Pittenweem, left Aberdeen on the ST. MAGNUS for Granton.

York Herald, 31/3/1884:
On Saturday, New steamer Dynamo, built by Earle's Shipbuilding and Engineering Co., for the Wilson line, went on a trial trip to sea. After getting clear of the river, course northward was set until withernsea was reached. Here Dynamo was subjected to the severest test as to her speed, running the measured mile time after time. She was in sea going trim, having taken in cargo of coals with which she will sail for Ghent. Mean speed of 6 runs about 11 knots, and vessel proved exceedingly handy on her helm, turning almost in her own length. Built of Belgian steel, a more graceful little craft has rarely been seen. She is for Messr's Wilson's Ghent trade [like Draco, 1882, bare hull presumably built by Duthie and completed by Earle's]

Captain said no coals had been measured nor was he aware of Mr. Oulton having been aboard. Captain said that a more iniquitous system of illegal taxation was never practiced than in Dublin on shipmasters. Oulton said he was entitled by virtue of regulations made by the Lord Mayor + Aldermen, President of the court asked Captain why, having long paid, had he refused now and could he not pass it on to customers for coal? Captain said he wanted to ascertain if these demands were legal and asked President to swear Mr. Oulton whether he was employed by or did any business with the Captain. President said he would not swear Mr. Oulton + made an order against the Captain.

Earl Sigurd launched 18 December at Hall Russell's yard, built specially for Kirkwall - islands of Orkney service. Propelling machinery consists of triple expansion engines with multitubular marine boiler, which is being installed by builders.

Earl Sigurd regularly went to the aid of trawlers stranded on Orkney islands, e.g.

- Cape Crozier (Hull) - ashore on Rive Skerry (Sanday). [P+J, 10/04/1931]
- Morvina (Grimsby) - ashore in fog on Kili Holm (Egilsay). Towed her off at high tide + took aboard crew of 10 when trawler subsequently sank. [Western Morning News, 14/05/1936]

Unsurprisigly, stormy + foggy weather affected Earls Sigurds sailings from time to time, e.g.

Orkney Herald, 24/01/1934:
Due to stormy weather made first call at North Ronaldsay 20 January since 21 December. Took mails + cargo aboard, but due to tidal conditions had to leave before some of stock waiting to be brought to Kirkwall was loaded.

Orkney Herald, 09/05/1947:

In one incident the EARL THORFINN left Stronsay on the morning of 31st January 1953 - the day of the great storm - bound for Sanday, another island not far to the North but was caught in a 100 miles an hour wind from the North West and gave the Master no choice but to run before it and eventually landed in Aberdeen.  She suffered much damage on deck which was virtually stripped of all moveable gear and it is creditable to her sturdiness and to the seamanship of her company that she survived, after being given up for lost.

Bertram got in touch with Earl Thorfinn authorising her to go to assistance. She put off her passengers at Eday. ET lay off at distance of 200 yards while trawler was made fast to her with several hundred fathoms steel wire. However, wind + tide prevented her being towed into deep water. ET remained in vicinity until after 12 hour trawler skipper came aboard (joining his crew). Crew of ET were subsequently ""financially rewarded"" for their assistance.

Allege commissioners were promptly advised of accumulation of stones at approach to pier and thart there was a similar incident on 27/08/1932.

Aberdeen Journal, 15/9/1869:
Eclipse returned to Aberdeen from Greenland last week.

Dundee Courier, 7/2/1873:
Mr Frank Buckland (campaigner against seal fishing) published in the Times, facts with regard to seal fishing sent him by Captain David Gray, master of screw steamer Eclipse, one of principal vessels which sail annually from Scotland in pursuit of whales and seals. ""On the seals being reached, the men are sent over the ice, the harpooners armed with rifles, the other men with seal clubs, knife and steel; also a rope to drag the skins to the ship, and now a work of brutal murder and cruelty goes on"" [follows detailed and graphic account of seal hunting] Buckland calls for interantional treaty among sealing vessels (20 from Scotland, 15-20 Norway, 2 Germany) to extend close season by 17 days. Presumably to delay start of season till pups less dependent on their mothers.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 8/11/1876:
Steamer City of Aberdeen, going to the shears for repair, became entangled with Peterhead whaling steamer Eclipse, in position for getting new boilers. Tug Heatherbell was employed for 2 hours extricating the vessels, fortunately without serious injury to either.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 10/3/1879:
Peterhead sealing fleet - Steamer Eclipse, Captain D. Gray, left Greenland.

Dundee Courier, 27/7/1881:
Steamer Eclipse, of Peterhead, arrived there from Greenland fishing and reports herself almost full - 3100 seals, 30 Bottlenoses, and 14 whales.

1891 Made last voyage from Peterhead. Sold to Dundee at end of year.

Dundee Courier, 30/9/1898:
At Dundee J.P. Court John Duncan, Steward, and Cumming Taylor, harpooner, were charged with having imported by the whaling steamer Eclipse 75 lbs manufactured Cavendish tobacco. Defence solicitor argued they were in habit of bartering with the natives and were allowed by government to have a certain amount of tobacco for this purpose, each fined £12 or 2 months imprisonment (1/10/1898 - fines paid.).

Courier and Argus, 26/4/1900:
The last of the whaling fleet for the Greenland and Davis Straits whale fishing left Dundee, when the steamer Eclipse, under command of Capt. Milne, left for latter place. Her departure was witnessed by hundreds of people. Hearty cheers were raised and customary ""blessing"" of oranges thrown aboard the steamer.

1909 Sold to Norway then Russia. Renamed LOMONASSOV and used as Artic exploration ship until 1930’s.  It was finally sunk in 1941 during a German air raid on Archangel'sk, while working as a Russian oceanographic vessel.

The first Aberdeen whalers sailed to the Arctic in 1752. By the early 19th century, 14 vessels went regularly to hunt the Greenland Right Whale. Its blubber provided lamp oil while whalebone, used in dressmaking, was also prized. Whaling was a risky business: vessels were sometimes crushed by ice. Others returned clean, with no catch. By the 1830s, overfishing had seriously affected the industry and Aberdeen vessels gradually abandoned the trade.

Galveston Island, Texas, March 2, 2011 - As the 1877 Tall Ship ELISSA nears the 30th anniversary of her historic restoration, 2011 will also mark another milestone for the Official Tall Ship of Texas. During a mandated United States Coast Guard dry dock inspection, various issues with the hull were identified as needing repairs. These repairs must be completed before she can be returned to sailing but will not prohibit her from operating in the water as one of Galveston's main tourist destinations and landmarks.

Queenslander, 21/3/1885:
Elissa have arrived in Brisbane with a full cargo of kerosive from New York.

Brisbane Courier, 2/4/1885:
Report of the Marine Board of Queensland on grounding of Barque Elissa in Brisbane River, 18/3/1885. In the evening, the Elissa, with Herbert Pomoroy as Master, was being towed up Brisbane River by tug otter. While stopped off for health inspection, she appeared to have drifted up river and to south side of channel. Tug was now alongside and when tug's starboard engines only were started, Elissa refused to come to and shortly after took the ground. It took the tug over one hour to pull the Elissa off and to other side of channel, warp was then let go to allow tug to turn, but it took so long to do this that the barque drifted up river and took the bank above Lytton. The tug eventually pulled her off, causing slight damage to both vessels. Board blamed pilot and tug.

Elissa sailed from Brisbane for Rangoon, 7/5/1885.

Glasgow Herald, 26/10/1864:
Stormm and floods on east coast. Eliza Hall of Whitby driven in at back of East Breakwater of Granton Harbour at height of gale on Saturday. She was commanded by Captain Carr and was bound from Gefle, Sweden to London with cargo of wood and iron. She had run to the Forth for shelter, but parted her cables and drove ashore on Sunday. Her crew were taken off by a party of officers and men from the Victoria, Revenue Cutter and Princess Royal, Fishery Cutter, who got a line aboard the ship and then drew the men ashore singly in a sling. Shortly after the vessel struck her mainmast went over the side and she thumped so heavily that her bottom and the side on which she lay were literally ground out and she now lies a total wreck, with remains of her spars and rigging floating around her. Crew have saved their effects and greater part of her sails and running rigging has been got ashore."

Arrival of clipper barque EMPEROR, Capt. William Bruce, at Liverpool from Bahia (Brazil) 28 May with 11 passengers.

Liverpool Mercury, 20/04/1857:
(Board of Trade Enquiry, Liverpool).  Barque EMPEROR, 363 tons, left Liverpool 28 March last for Bahia with full cargo of general merchandise.  Vessel rounded Holyhead about midnight and set SW course.  At 11.0am land was sighted, which Chief Officer reported to be Bardsey (Wales) about 10 miles distant.  Captain Mitchell did not see the land himself, but went down to dinner.  By late afternoon weather was very thick, but Captain considered himself to be mid Channel (St. George's Channel).  She struck land off Merris Castle to eastward of Blackwater Head about 14 miles from Wexford.  Her wheel, rudder head and everything abaft the windlass except the upper works of the ship were carried away and she became unmanageable.  Whole of the crew and passengers (2 ladies) got safely ashore by the boats.  Captain immediately went to Wexford and engaged a steamer to try to save the wreck.  When he returned on following morning vessel had disappeared, having drifted about 4 miles to NE over the bank.  At the enquiry Capt. Mitchell attributed loss of ship to mate having been deceived by fog into thinking Bardsey was 10 miles distant when it must have been 20.  Despite testimonial that he was in general a very careful navigator, Captain's certificate was withdrawn on grounds he should have known distances were difficult to judge in fog and should have been sounding depth with lead."

'A lone bugler played the Last Post as the last crew of the Taioma climbed into an inflatable and moved away from the tug.  Ever so slowly and gracefully the tug sank lower and lower in the water.  It was a rather moving burial at sea.  Then with a final gush, a flick of the stern and a last puff of black soot from the funnel, the waters wrapped around the Taioma.  She sank upright and proud to the sandy bottom 27 metres below.' 

Divers report that it is now possible to swim down the funnel and into the engine room."

Gross Tonnage: 1965 ton","Esso Petroleum Co. Ltd, London",,,"Yard Number: 849

Delivered to Esso on 19 March 1956 at Fawley.  Vessel was Esso's first bulk bitumen tanker.  When not engaged in carrying bitumen, also transported heavy fuel oils, particularly in later years of service.  Bitumen was loaded at a temperature of 280-300F and was kept at this temperature during voyages by a bank of steam-heated coils in each of the five centre cargo tanks.
In later years, ESSO PRESTON was on a regular run supplying fuel oil to Barking Power Station on the River Thames.
On 14 January 1959 ESSO PRESTON was in collision in the River Mersey with MV VELARDE which was at anchor off Sandon Dock.  Sustained damage to sheer structure, deck plating, starboard ballast tank, hatch coaming, main and boat deck guardrails and poopdeck guardrails and flagstaff.
On 4 January 1963 ESSO PRESTON collided in the River Thames with MV HERMANN BLUME which was at anchor off Goldsmith's Wharf, Grays.  Minor damage caused to both ships.
At 20:53 local time on 31 January 1975 ESSO PRESTON ran aground on Calf Rock, near Roches Point, County Cork, during a moderately heavy sea.  Had been en route to the Whitegate Refinery to take on a cargo of fuel oil.  Holed in numbers 1, 3 and 4 of cargo spaces.  Refloated under own power within 13 minutes and anchored off Whitegate Jetty for the night.  Port anchor had to be jettisoned to avoid being dragged further on to the rock if it had been weighed.
Received approval from Lloyds to sail to Cardiff 2 February 1975, arriving on 3rd.  Examined in the Mount Stewart Drydock of Bristol Channel Shiprepairers Ltd, Cardiff on 6 February, severe damage being found to cargo tanks, pipework and engine room.  Full damage survey was carried with Lloyds on 7 February.
ESSO PRESTON remained laid up at Cardiff pending a decision on repairs, which were later found to be uneconomic.  Declared a constructive total loss to Esso's Underwriters on 14 February, as the value of the hull and machinery was estimated at £84,000 and the cost of repairs estimated at £200,000.  Crew was advised on same day and paid off, articles closed on 17 February.  Deck log was closed the following day and ship's log sent to DTI Cardiff.
Replaced in 1981 with ESSON AVON.
Sold to Jose Luis Blanco (shipbreakers) at Aviles, near Gijon, Spain.  Arrived there 1 April 1975."

Sydney Morning Herald, 15/04/1867:
The anxiety which has been caused to many persons in this city in consequence of a dismasted vessel being seen off the port has been happily dispelled by arrival of ETHIOPIAN in tow of the French steamer MARCEAU, which fell in with her about 35 miles from the Heads.  From the appearance of the vessel's deck she must have suffered considerably.
From Captain Falconer's log; Thursday 7th March 1867 - Noon, heavy beam sea, ship rolling heavily and shipping much water on board.  Latitude 16.50S, Longitude 170.10E, off New Hebrides. 
1pm increasing sea, ship not rolling so much, brought ship to close reefed main topsail, secured everything about deck and made snug for a fresh gale.  At 4 squalls increasing and a tremendous sea.  At 4.30 blowing a severe gale, with rain and very heavy squalls, ship laying over with lee rails in the water. Main topsail blew out.  Tried to get ship before the wind but she would not go off, being too far over. At 5 blowing a furious hurricane, with incessant rain and heavy lightning, the sea a complete sheet of foam flying over the ship.
At 5:30 we were struck by an awful gust, which hove the ship right over on her beam ends, the sea half way over her deck, washing away everything off her deck.  Ship appeared to be settling over slowly.  All hands standing outside weather rails expecting they had only a few minutes left to live I ordered the mizzen & main mast to be cut away, which only required a few lanyards cut, when they went over the side.  Still blowing furiously with tremendous sea.  No sign of ship righting.  Cut away the foremast, which appeared to ease her a little.  Called the chief officer, Mr Anderson, but he could not be found. He was last seen going to cut away the main rigging, when he must have been washed over board. Other 3 were washed overboard, but succeeded in getting on board again. 
Carpenter reported that she had shifted her cargo and water was up to stringer on lee side. Sent all hands below to trim the coals.  Gale decreasing but ship still laying over, with water getting into hold. Secured forecastle ports with sails.  Hurricane overnight with wind, sea and rain which cut like a knife.  Pitch dark except when lightning flashed.  No-one on board expected to see morning.  If ship had not been strong she would not have stood what she did. 
Cut away masts at 6:15.  Daylight - got one of pumps to work & people trimming coals, but found ship helpless wreck. Only the bowsprit standing. Noon - ship righting and water decreasing. Hove overboard about 20 tons coals.  
Sunday 10th; very nearly upright, ship quite tight, under way with jury masts.

The ETHIOPIAN left Sydney on 24 October 1874 arriving London 23 January 1875 carrying a cargo of wool. Another wool run left Geelong 7 November 1883 arriving London 12 February 1884.
On 22 July 1881 she sailed from London to Melbourne returning on 21 March 1882 under Capt. N. Allan. Ships Carpenter was David Alexander from Aberdeen.

'The ETHIOPIAN made her first voyage to Melbourne in sixty-eight days under Capt. William Edward, sailing her last voyage under the British Flag in 1886, being by that time reduced to a barque rig.
On her passage home from Sydney she had a remarkable race with the iron ship ORONTES. The two vessels cast off their tugs together outside Sydney Heads, proceeded to sea and next sighted each other off the Horn, afterwards being becalmed together in the Doldrums, then both spore the same ship (exchanged signals) off the Azores or Western Isles. As they reached the Channel, ORONTES came up under the counter of ETHIOPIAN, which was hove-to taking soundings in fog. Finally ETHIOPIAN made the East India Docks one tide ahead of ORONTES, thus winning the race and a considerable sum in wagers'.
(Source: Lubbock 'The Colonial Clippers')

'Capt. Dalrymple of the DUKE OF ABERCORN was evidently full of confidence that his ship could beat any other ship in Shanghai on the race home, and he proceeded to challenge every clipper which was going to load new teas. This sporting spirit led to a great deal of betting amongst the shipping fraternity, and finally the crews of the CUTTY SARK, DUKE OF ABERCORN, SERICA, FORWARD HO, ARGONAUT, ETHIOPIAN and the JOHN R. WORCESTER waged a month's pay, to go to the ship which made the quickest passage from Shanghai to the Channel. The race was won by the Cutty Sark'.
(Source: Lubbock 'The Log of the Cutty Sark')

The ETHIOPIAN carried tea from Shanghai, leaving 1st July 1870 and arriving London 12th November under Capt. Faulkner. 134 days out.
(Source: Lubbock 'The China Clippers)

The ETHIOPIAN had an interesting arrangement for her accommodation, which was placed in a large deckhouse extending from side to side.  The rail was approximately 4ft 6ins above the deck and the sides of the house were rounded down on to the rail; just as in a poop extending right to the stern.  But there was a gap between the after end of the house and taff rail in which was a low deck occupied by binnacle, wheel and wheel box.  To get forward from the wheel meant going up over the house by means of the ladders provided, or else down steps through the house and out on to the main deck. This arrangement was only found in a few sailing ships in the early 1860s.  Although it can be seen in some steamers.

Sold to Norwegian owners.  In October 1894, when bound from St Thomas to Cork, was abandoned near the Western Isles.  It was afterwards picked up 15 miles from Fayal and towed into St Michael's, where it was condemned.

This is the second boat EXPEDITION has lost since her arrival and a third received considerable damage.

Morning Post, 27/07/1826 (from Aberdeen Chronicle, 22/07/1826):
EXPEDITION, Watson, arrived Aberdeen Bay after fine passage of 44 days from Montego Bay.  On 3rd June, while about 20 miles south of Carisford Reef, Florida Keys, was chased by a schooner which, on coming near, appeared to have a long gun amidships.  The schooner, although named from a friendly port, having Tropic of Baltimore on her stern, gave chase to another brig, which she overhauled in an incredible short time, and was still alongside her at dark next day.  From her manner of manoevering and other suspicious circumstances, there is every reason to believe her a pirate.

Steel boiler and triple-expansion engines will be supplied and fitted up by the builders.
The launch was witnessed by a large company of friends, and, as the vessel left the ways, she was christened Fair Isle by Miss Michael.
The company afterwards adjourned to the offices of the builders, where they were entertained by a cake and wine banquet.  Mr James Hunter presided, and others present included Mr, Mrs and Miss Inglis, Miss Michael, Mr R Thomson, superintendent engineer, Leith; Mr Garden, Banchory; Mr James Y. Hunter, Mr James H.

The Chairman proposed ""Success to the Fair Isle.""  This was Mr Inglis' first vessel, but they all hoped she would be so successful that he would be back soon for another one.  (Applause.)
Mr Inglis, in reply, expressed the hope that the chairman's kind wishes would be amply fulfilled.  Times were not so good as they would wish them to be, but he felt that the period of depression would pass away, and bring prosperity in the near future.  (Applause.)
The Fair Isle had taken the water in a business-like way that was a credit to the builders, whose health he asked the company to pledge. (Applause.)
Mr James H. Anderson responded.
Mr James Y. Hunter proposed ""The Health of Miss Michael,"" and Mr Thomson replied; after which the proceedings terminated with the toast of ""Bon-Accord."""

'Trawler Launched at Aberdeen'
'A new steam trawler to the order of Mr James Inglis, Leith, was launched from the shipbuilding yard of Messrs A. Hall and Co., Ltd., yesterday afternoon in presence of a large company.  As the vessel left the ways she was christened the Fair View by Miss Michael.  The dimensions of the vessel are as follows: Length 112ft.; breadth 22ft.; depth (moulded), 12ft. 6in.
The Fair View is to be fitted with triple expansion engines, with a boiler working at a pressure of 180lbs.
The company afterwards adjourned to the office of the builders, where they were entertained at a cake and wine banquet.  Mr A. Farquhar presided, and among those present were Mr, Mrs and Miss Inglis, Leith; Miss Michael, Leith; Baillie Todd, Baillie Edwards, Councillor Gibb and Mrs Gibb, Councillor Leith, Councillor Newton, Mr W. M. Brechin, Mrs Farquhar, Mrs Bell, Kilmarnock, Mr J. S. Stuart and Mrs Stuart, Misses Farquhar, Misses Rust, Miss Gray, Mr J. S. Melville, Mr W. D. Kirkwood, Mr R. Thomson, superintending engineer; Captain William George, etc.
The Chairman gave ""Success to the Fair View.""  He hoped the vessel would be very successful, and that Mr Inglis would get a good return for the money he laid out. (Applause.)
Mr Inglis, in reply, hoped the depression in trade would soon take a more favourable turn.  We had advantages in this country compared with our Continental competitors in so far that our industries were in close proximity to our coalfields.  He was of the opinion that we favoured the foreigner too much by having taken the export tax off coals.  If that tax were on it would greatly help our trade at home and expand it abroad.  (Applause.)  He proposed ""The Builders.""
The Chairman, replying, said it had always been the endeavour of Messrs Hall and Company to put into the vessels they built the very best workmanship that could be produced.
Baillie Edwards submitted ""The Fishing Industry.""  He paid a high compliment to the builders of the Fair View, and referred to the important part played by the fishing industry in the commercial prosperity of Aberdeen.
Mr J. S. Melville responded.  He hoped the dark cloud which hung over the industry would soon clear away.  (Applause.)
Other toasts followed.
Mr J. S. Stuart gave ""The Town and Trade of Aberdeen"" and Baillie Todd acknowledged.
Mr W. D. Kirkwood proposed ""The Ladies,"" and Mr W. M. Brechin, in a racy speech, responded.
The proceedings concluded with the singing of ""Auld Lang Syne."""

Moreton Bay Courier, 04/08/1857:
Barque FAME, barque, 210 tons, Capt. Poole, bound for Melbourne with coals, was wrecked in Port Jackson (Sydney). In one of severest easterly gales for several years, she was anchored at the Heads for shelter, but drifted.  The masts of the FAME were seen close to the sow and pigs, the hull having completely disappeared. From particulars supplied by the Master, Capt. Poole, FAME went on shore at 2a.m. and as terrific sea was running, there was no possible chance of saving the vessel. A boat was got out in which all hands (except one, who preferred remaining by the wreck) escaped. The boat was knocking about for 3 hours before it could find a safe landing place. At great personal risk to Capt. Jenkins, the main remaining by the ship was rescued. Though FAME has become total wreck, all hands fortunately saved.

Newcastle Weekly Courant, 30/1/1885:
A Newbiggin fishing boat at sea about 6 miles ENE of Newbiggin fell in with the crew of the steamer FERRIFER, of Dundee, which had gone ashore on some rocks south of the Coquet (Island near Amble, Northumberland) during dense fog. The men had to take to their boat immediately as the steamer went to pieces. They had rowed about from 6 o'clock previous evening till 8 o'clock following morning. They were landed on the beach by the fishing boat, having lost everything. They were kindly cared for at the King's Head Inn and afterward forwarded to their homes in Aberdeen by Mr. Brown, agent at Newbiggn for the shipwrecked fishermen and mariners society. Vessel was on voyage from Middlesborough to Dundee with cargo of iron. She was under command of Captain Spence and owned by James Wallace & Co.

In November 1918 the Aberdeen Coal & Shipping Company accepted Hall Russell's offer of £59,000 to build a sister ship to the REDHALL.  The new steamer was launched at Footdee on 9th September 1919 and named FERRYHILL. 
With a carrying capacity of 1400 tons she immediately started making smart passages and she delivered 3 cargoes from Grangemouth to Aberdeen in the space of 5 ½ days.
It is interesting to note that no more colliers with engines amidship were built after the FERRYHILL, this was to give more space for cargo.  However the advantage of the engine midships type over engines aft was evident in heavy weather when the screw came out of the water.  The weight of the long propeller shaft reduced the tendency to race and maintained better speeds.

Loss of FERRYHILL, 21st January 1940:
The swift and tragic sinking of the FERRYHILL was distinguished by the brave conduct of her chief mate, James McGill Ovenston, who tried to save the chief engineer by getting him on to a door which had floated clear of the ship.  Unfortunately his rescue bid was in vain and he, and second engineer John King Grassie, were the only 2 survivors.  They were in the water for 35 minutes before being picked up.  James Ovenstone was later awarded the OBE for his gallantry.

Struck a mine laid by a German Submarine.  Exact location is in dispute - possible location is 2,200 metres off Seaton Sluice.  Wreck was dispersed using explosives in 1955.  Her hull was owned then by the Ministry of War transport who had no interest in her cargo - 1200 tons of coal.

Last mention in Lloyd's Register of Shipping 1939-40.

700 Ton lift
Construction: Welded

The pontoon FLOATING DOCK was built by John Lewis in 1955 for the Aberdeen Harbour Board and situated at the top end of Point Law next to the fish market to replace the older pontoon.  The pontoon was one of two pontoons situated in Point Law to enable trawl owners to dry dock their trawlers for painting and cleaning below the water line.  Other commerical vessels could use the facilities if they were under 500 tons.

They operated by opening valves at the side and letting water in which was pumped into tanks made in the structure of the pontoon.  When a vessel was positioned on the dock the water was pumped out and the vessel and pontoon rose out of the water.  The pontoon dock was broken up in the Hall Russell dry dock round about 2000/2002 (Pontoon No. 4 was getting a refit as the quayside at Point Law was being strengthened) as there was no demand for its use due to the drop in the size of the fishing fleet."

We were 7 days in company with TEIPING once and ten days with SIR LANCELOT.  Their Captains drove them harder in strong winds.

Australian Newspapers Online:

Perth Gazette and West Australian Times, 16/11/1866:
Great Ship Race from China: the arrival on Sept 6 in the downs, off Deal, of three of the nine clipper ships engaged in a great ocean race from China created much interest in the city.  FLYING SPUR, 731 tons, sailed June 5, 7 days after the first ship.  The ships were laden with the first cargo of teas of the season - additional freight of 10 shillings per ton allowed to first ship arriving in dock.  The ARIEL and TAEPING, which had lost sight of each other for 70 days, found themselves on Sept 5 off the Lizard running neck and neck up the Channel under every stitch of canvas that could be set (TAEPING just ahead).  The distance, 14060 miles, was run in 99 days.  [No ref. in this report to FLYING SPUR'S time, but quotes her 1865 time as 131 days (placed 5th - winning time 109 days, FIERY CROSS].

Brisbane Courier, 26/12/1867:
1867 Tea Race: FLYING SPUR 4th (116 days with 49,710 lbs tea). First was ARIEL (102 days, 1,283,000 lbs tea).

Melbourne Argus, 13/01/1869:
Run home from Foochow with new season teas in invariably regarded as the Great Race, the crucial test of a ship's capability... clipper SPINDRIFT was the winner last year having been out 15 1/2 hours less than her competitors, though amongst these were ARIEL, the TAEPING, the BLACK PRINCE, the FLYING SPUR and others equally famous.

From 19th Century British Newspapers, 25 December 1880:
Messrs Hall Russell & Co. have built four steamers during 1880.  The first vessel launched was the FOKIEN a screw steamer for Messrs Douglas Lapraik & Co. of Hong Kong for the Chinese Coasting trade. 

From the Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 25 January 1880:
Launch of a Vessel
There was launched from the building yard of Messrs Hall Russell & Co. of Footdee, on Monday, a finely modelled iron screw steamer, name of the FOLKIEN. This vessel has been built under special survey and classed at Lloyd's and will be fitted with compound surface condensing engines, steam winches, water ballast, patent windlass, and all the most approved appliances for facilitating loading and discharging cargo. She has splendid accommodation for about fifty first class passengers and 250 steerage passengers and is fitted fore and aft with large scuttles for light and ventilation. The FOKIEN has been built to the order of Messrs Douglas, Lapraik & Co, London for the China Coasting Trade where she will be commanded by Capt. Ashton. As the vessel left the ways she was gracefully named the FOKIEN by Miss Couper, Craigiebuckler, and afterwards taken to the sheer poles to receive masts and machinery.

24 February 1880: Sailed lightship (empty) from Aberdeen under Capt. Ashton bound for China.
4 March 1880: Passed Gibraltar.
20 April 1880: At Hong Kong.
28 April 1880: Left Swatow for Amoy - Coastwise.
30 August 1881: Severe typhoon raging at the ports of Tamsui and Kelung on the 25th and 26th inst. FOKIEN of Aberdeen Under Capt. Abbott was beached to prevent her dragging out to sea but was, afterwards, got out without apparent damage.
1882: Lloyd's Register gives Master's name as S. Ashton.
1883: Transferred to Douglas Steamship Co.
1884: Lloyd's Register gives Master's name as H.C.A. Harris and the owner as The Douglas Steamship Co. Ltd, Hong Kong.

""Melancholy Loss of the Forth packet"" (Caledonian Mercury, 18 December 1817):
""At nine o'clock it began to blow a violent gale. Between twelve and one o'clock today a vessel appeared in the offing, apparently driving in towards the shore. At this time the tide was scarcely half flood, and as the wind was blowing almost right inshore and a tremendous sea running, the greatest anxiety was manifested for her safety... The vessel which was now plainly observed from the shore, was smack rigged, and appeared (to be) making exertions to gain the harbour... the crew, whether from fatigue or some defect in the vessel seemed to have but little management of her, consequently after almost gaining the river, she was struck by some tremendous seas, and precipitated on the Annette, a sand bank running out of the entrance to the harbour.  The situation of those on board the vessel now became perilous in the extreme - the tide forcing her inshore, and the waves breaking over her with great violence. Two fishing boats had proceeded to the mouth of the river... but, from heavy seas, were unable, after repeated attempts, to cross the bar. The lifeboat, which was brought to the beach and manned with greatest alacrity, now proceeded to the vessel, and, though repeatedly driven back, succeeded in getting so close to her as to throw a rope with a grappling iron on board... but it unfortunately gave way and the boat was driven, by the fury of the sea and wind, to leeeward of the vessel, and was unable to make up again... the lifeboat now rowed inshore, and came round by the deep water on the back of the Annette. The boat now made for the vessel a second time, but, melancholy to relate, before they could reach her, she was overset, and her mast giving way she was turned literally keel uppermost, and every soul on board perished. At the time the lifeboat was alongside, they spoke to those on board and ascertained the vessel to be the Forth Packet of Aberdeen, Thomas Galloway Master, with 20 persons on board, men, women, and children... From the shore the spectators beheld the agonies of those on board, each clinging desperately to whatever they could lay hold of, to preserve them from the devouring clement around; one young woman was observed among the passengers, with an infant at her breast; and now in an instant all were buried in the ocean.

This beautiful vessel is now loading... only room for limited quantity of goods.

In 1855 FOX belonged to Sir Richard Sutton, 2nd baronet.  Master: Capt. James Palmer of Aberdeen sailed Sir R. Sutton to Norway and back and was presented with a silver cup from the passengers, guests of Sir Sutton, 1st September 1855.

Sutton died in 1855 and the vessel was sold. Bought 1857 by Lady Franklin to search for her husband; Sir John Franklin's lost Arctic expedition of 1845.  In 1858 Captain McClintock led an expedition in the FOX to find the remains of Sir Franklin's team on King William Island.  FOX left Aberdeen on 1 July 1857, under the command of Capt Young, and managed to pass through the Bellot Strait briefly before finding a secure winter anchorage to the east of the Strait off the Boothia Peninsula. Over the next two years extensive expeditions were made by sled to the west of the Boothia Peninsula. 

On 6 May 1859 Lt. William Hobson, the ship's second in command, discovered the only written messages from the missing expedition ever found, in cairns on King William Island. The overland parties returned to the ship, which then left for Plymouth, arriving on 20 September. 

Aberdeen Free Press & Buchan News 21st October 1859, page 5:
'Lady Franklin has resolved to sell the steam yacht FOX, which so successfully conveyed Captain McClintock and his brother heroes to the fulfilment of their mission.'

FOX subsequently passed into Danish ownership and worked the west coast of Greenland for 55 years as a supply vessel until its final abandonment.  Partially sunk in Godhavn harbour in 1912, the vessel broke up in or around 1940, disintegrated and sunk.

Information from Mr Linnet: 
'I recovered the propeller shafting and stern tube, with part of the stern.  There also is an ingenious arrangement for changing a broken propeller at sea.  I have a little ship repair business, and some years ago, we were building a pontoon bridge in Godhavn and recovered those things because they would have otherwise been destroyed.  The ice has destroyed most of the hull but the boiler is still in one piece and part of the bottom of the ship.  It was built of teak and oak and the fastenings under the waterline are all bronze.  She was copper sheathed.  The navigational mark on an island outside Godhavn called 'Blubber Island' is made from the FOX funnel and painted red.'

The propeller is now on display at the entrance to Aberdeen Maritime Museum."

Named after Francis Henty (1815-89), the youngest son of Thomas and Frances Elizabeth Henty, born in West Tarring, Sussex, England. At the age of 17 he travelled to Launceston with his parents. Two years later he followed his brother Edward to Portland, becoming Victoria's second settler and reputedly the first to bring merino sheep across to the Port Phillip District. After his marriage to Mary Ann Lawrence in Launceston in 1842, Henty settled at Merino Downs in the Western District. [State Library of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia].

 A painting of ""Francis Henty""  appears in the book ""Early Painters of Australia,1788-1880""  by Shar Jones. This painting was done by  Thomas Robertson, a Melbourne artist, whilst the vessel was at Portland Bay, Victoria, sometime in 1858.

On 2 December, she parted her cables and as she went onto Newfound Island, in St Mary's Pool, Captain Fordyce ordered her masts to be cut away.  A rocket line from the shore saved her crew of 22.  Three small shiploads of tea, sails, spars and some stores were taken to London but the islanders managed to 'acquire' large quantities of tea, despite the efforts of coastguards and preventive men.  A lasting monument to the FRIAR TUCK, apart from her figurehead, are the Chinese geese on Tresco which are descendants of those which came ashore from the wreck.  The ship had been a good investment for her owners with profits of £12,389 over six years.  It was the promise of such returns which induced owners to spend money on fine figureheads and other decoration for their vessels.

FRISKY was built for the Royal Navy as a 1200HP tug moving redundant capital ships. HMS FRISKY had two funnels and two masts. FRISKY was sold early on in her career to Germany and renamed GUSTAVO IPLAND and was laid up in Hamburg for a considerable time before being purchased in 1930 by Foundation Maritime and renamed FOUNDATION FRANKLIN. Owners in 1930 were J. W. Sutherland.

By 1937 she is described as a salvage vessel and is owned by Foundation Maritime, Ltd and is registered in Halifax, N.S.

In 1942 she salvaged the trooper WAKEFIELD ex US liner MANHATTAN (24,289GRT) ablaze in the North Atlantic which she saved on her own for 5 days. 4 USN diesel tugs were deployed to assist but couldn't cope with the conditions of another mission. She was towing the recalcitrant stern half of LIBERTY ship and found they were heading into the middle of a 100 ship convoy blocking their path to St. John's. 
In early 1945 whem embayed overnight she found herself unnoticed sharing an ice lagoon with German U-boat recharging its batteries.
FRISKY had a big refit with the bridge being removed, a deck house installed and the wheelhouse placed on top of the deckhouse, the foremast was shifted further forward and a derrick attached to the mast and bow chock added. A derrick was fited to the aftermast and the coal burning engine was replaced in 1948 with a diesel unit.
FRISKY was scrapped in 1950, location unknown.

GALERNA AND VENDAVAL:

For a brief period two Aberdeen built ships achieved international prominence as symbols of the conflicting loyalties of the war in Spain.  Trawlers 692 and 693 were named GALERNA and VENDAVAL.  Built to identical specifications they were big vessels, much larger and more powerful than the fishing boats usually built by Hall, Russell & Co.  Typically boats fishing out of Aberdeen would be 115 to 120 feet long; GALERNA and VENDAVAL were 215 feet from stem to stern. In keeping with overall length were their fish holds of nearly 30,000 cubic feet.  Set aft of the superstructure were twin boilers, heated by six furnaces, these powered a triple expansion steam engine.  On deck was a twin drum heavy duty winch capable of carrying 1200 fathoms of hawser on each drum.  Unlike most of the Aberdeen trawling fleet these vessels were equipped with wireless and equally modern for a fishing boat were the electric lights found below decks and on deck (for shooting or hauling nets in darkness); far better and safer than the ""bubbly"" oil lamps then often found on trawlers.  But modern as they were with new technologies they did have one structural thing in common with the smallest of Aberdeen trawlers, accommodation for ordinary seamen was in the foc'sle, above and adjacent to stores, at the stem where the ship punched through high seas, a place with few concessions to comforts.

GALERNA and VENDAVAL cost £32000 each. GALERNA's and VENDAVAL's fishing grounds were to be the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.

GALERNA and VENDAVAL were owned by Basque company Pesquerias y Secaderos de Bacalao de Espana (PSYBE, Salt Cod Fishermen and Driers of Spain). Ordered as identical vessels in May 1927 GALERNA was launched in November of the same year, VENDAVAL followed close behind taking to the water in December.  

For centuries Spain had fished the Grand Banks off Newfoundland seeking out the once prolific cod. And so it was in 1928 that these not so humble Aberdeen built trawlers entered a trade with a long history.  At the time the question of foreign boats trawling the fishing stocks off Newfoundland and Canadian waters was a contentious issue.  Vessels like GALERNA and VENDAVAL added to the problem.  From day one of the steam trawling industry builders and owners had looked for ways of increasing the catching power of vessels keeping pace with or outdistancing competitors. GALERNA and VENDAVAL were part of this process. Their powerful engines and winches gave them the ability to take many more fish than the traditional Newfoundland fleet, in other words play a not insignificant role in overfishing fragile waters. Regardless of this an even more immediately catastrophic situation was to overtake not only the fishing industry but the globe: PSYBE had placed their order for advanced boats just two years before the stock market crash and the onset of the Great Depression.  Not a moment for large-scale investment in trawlers.  But the company survived and in 1936 both vessels were in home ports in the north of Spain.

On 17 July 1936 Francisco Franco led a coup against the Republican Government. The Spanish Civil War had begun.  

Franco's intention was to take control of the whole of Spain including the Basque country. So the Basques prepared for war. Bilbao was the centre of resistance. On the south east corner of the Bay of Biscay the city's port channelled the region's imports and exports and it was in the waters of the Bay that trawlers GALERNA and VENDAVAL made their mark in the bloody conflict.

From the earliest days anti-Franco forces looked to total mobilisation of the regional defences. Central to this was utilising fishing fleets. Almost every vessel was seen as potential for the newly formed Basque Auxiliary Navy and the two Aberdeen boats were high on the list for requisitioning. Their power and size made them an ideal complement to the few genuine naval ships under Basque control.

In late 1936 GALERNA and VENDAVAL were commandeered, the former for the Basque Auxiliary Navy. She was fitted with 101mm and 57mm guns. Sadly GALERNA was to have a less gallant role when in October 1936 the trawler was boarded and seized by pro-Franco seamen and like her sister ship was armed and made ready for battle.  GALERNA became auxiliary support in the Nationalist navy destined to work with the cruiser ALMIRANTE CERVERA.

After fitting out as an armed trawler VENDAVAL took up escort duties in the Bay of Biscay: her role was to help keep the seaway open to ships entering and leaving the port.  Manned with over forty of a crew through November and early December the armed vessel guided cargo ships to the safety of harbour.  On 15 December the fishing boat was renamed NABARRA and it was in this guise that she achieved worldwide fame becoming a symbol of absolute defiance to the brutalities of Spanish (and by extension all European) fascism.  Before 1936 was out NABARRA was involved in a confrontation with a German merchant ship PALOS. Accompanied by another armed trawler, BIZKAYA, the Aberdeen boat arrested PALOS and forced her to berth in Bilbao. Hitler's Nazi German unsurprisingly had thrown its weight behind Franco and any German vessel approaching Spain was suspected of carrying arms or other war materials to the nationalists and hence was open to search and arrest. But Hitler was a big player in a dangerous game and when the German cruiser KONIGSBERG appeared off Bilbao on the 28th December it became obvious that Franco's Nazi supporter was not going to sit by and have his nation's ships seized. With little choice the Basques released PALOS.

Into 1937 and the war at sea intensified. Franco was attacking Bilbao from the land and sought to starve out the Basques. To this end mines were laid in the Bay of Biscay with the hope that this would not only inflict damage on the Basque Navy but also and probably more importantly deter foreign ships from trading with the Basques. On the 7th-8th of January NABARRA took up the challenge and chased off Nationalist ships VELASCO and GENOVEVA FIERRO which were laying mines just off Bilbao. Although Franco's mine laying operations were largely unsuccessful eight days after NABARRO forced VELASCO from the area the minelayer returned put down a field which caught a Basque patrol boat and minesweeper; both were sunk and 23 men died.

As the conflict deepened so NABARRA and her sister ships were called to increasing action coming to a head on the 5th of March 1937.  Four armed republican trawlers were escorting merchant ship GALDAMES to Bilbao when about Cape Matxitxako they encountered Franco's cruiser CANARIES which was then in the process of arresting the British registered YORKBROOK. A battle to free YORKBROOK ensued. CANARIES turned her guns on armed trawler GIPUZKOA. On fire and with five men dead GIPUZKOA made for Portugalete, east of Santander. Meanwhile shore batteries opened fire on CANARIES forcing her to momentarily withdraw. But respite was short for the Basque naval forces. Sighting GLADAMES and her escort the rebel cruiser returned to the fight. In a face to face battle the armed trawlers stood little chance against the cruiser, it was faster and more heavily armed than the fishing vessels.

Trawler BIZKAYA ran with YORKBROOK eventually finding refuge at Bermeo east of Bilbao. This left the lightly armed DONOSTIA and NABARRA protecting GALDAMES. DONOSTIA succeeded in breaking towards the French coast.  NABARRA was alone. Her master Enrique Moreno did all he could, he was resolute in defiance of the cruiser. But against a ship carrying 203mm turret mounted guns NABARRA had no chance. The skilled men in Aberdeen had done everything they could to make a seaworthy vessel; it was a good fishing boat but carried no armour plating. The riveted hull had withstood the storms of the North Atlantic. Steaming in dangerous seas, shooting, trawling and hauling nets this was what VENDAVAL-NABARRA was designed for not fending off a cruiser's shells. First to die was the Bos'n; then came a direct hit on her boilers which killed most of the engineers and stokers and ended any slight chance the ship had of escaping. Captain Moreno gave his men the opportunity to abandon ship, however, knowing that this would mean being taken prisoner by CANARIES he along with his next in command Ambrosio Sarasola chose to stay with the sinking vessel.

Out of a crew of forty nine only twenty men survived. They were taken prisoner, tried by Franco's court and sentenced to death. Fortunately their bravery in defying the might of CANARIES was recognised, the commander of the cruiser recommended that they be spared which Franco allowed: an act of humanity which stands in stark contrast to the brutality typical of the dictator's rule. 

And what of sister ship GALERNA? While NABARRA was being pounded to submission and loss GALERNA was earning a less than glorious reputation. History's hand was also upon ship 692: captured and manned by pro-Franco seamen the trawler was doing it all it could to harry and forestall any help being sent to the Basques. She was in the Bay of Biscay attempting to stop arms, raw materials and food getting to beleaguered Bilbao. Supporting the cruiser ALMIRANTE CERVERA the armed GALERNA patrolled waters outside the three mile limit and beyond the reach of republican shore batteries and in this role the ship achieved international notoriety, indeed, she became involved in a series of incidents which brought the Royal Navy close to breaking the British Government's stance of so-called non-intervention in Spain.

On the 6th of April 1937 Franco decreed that he was to enforce a blockade on the city of Bilbao. Up until then his navy had sporadically tried to stop all mercantile traffic to the port but with little success. By formally declaring a blockade he hoped to exploit the apparently supine action of European governments and scare off all traders. GALERNA and ALMIRANTE CERVERA were key players in this strategy.  The British response was to declare that all waters beyond the three mile limit were high seas and therefore in principle Franco should not interfere with lawful merchant vessels. However, there was some comfort in this for Franco as the British Government's main concern was to avoid confrontation. Ignoring intelligence coming from the Royal Navy and consulate personnel that there was no serious risk from mines in the Bay of Biscay the Government warned ships to avoid the area. The merchant marine paid no heed; operators saw the opportunity for good business and continued to trade. In a political rather than a naval display of force the Government dispatched Royal Navy ships to the Bay with the intention of advising British ships to avoid Spanish waters.

Events overtook the Government's cautious appeasement when the British registered THORPEHALL steamed to Bilbao.  Ten miles from the Basque coastline GALENRA sighted the ""blockade runner"" and fired on the unarmed merchant vessel.  GALERNA's master intended to do all he could to prevent much needed supplies reaching the Basques. THORPEHALL sent a message to the destroyer HMS BRAZEN which arriving on the scene ordered the armed trawler to pull away. All looked under control when ALMIRANTE CERVERA steamed to the scene and the Royal Naval ship now found itself outgunned.  However, irrespective of this BRAZEN's commander decided to face-down the Nationalists and he put his ship on actions stations whereupon GALERNA made for ALMIRANTE and the two took up position between THORPEHALL and the coast in an attempt to stop it entering Basque territorial waters. Royal Naval destroyers BLANCHE and BEAGLE were then called to assist the seriously threatened BRAZEN. Within an hour it looked like this stand-off was about to escalate into a much more serious incident when the German pocket battleship ADMIRAL GRAF SPEE came upon the scene, however, she adopted a conciliatory stance and advised the Spanish vessels to pull off.  THORPEHALL was instructed to enter Bilbao but Franco's navy was not done and had one final attempt at enforcing the blockade yet again with no success: The three destroyers placed themselves between the cruiser and the Aberdeen trawler and thanks to the intervention of the Royal Navy THORPEHALL made port safely.  British opposition MPs contrasted the resolute action of the Royal Navy with the ""turning tail"" stance of the Government saying it had hauled down the down the White Ensign and ""hauled up the white flag"".

On the 13th of April, a week after the stand-off, ALMIRANTE CERVERA's commander sent the message that henceforward any British ships found within Spanish territorial waters would be seized or sunk and that the territorial limit was to be extended from three to six miles (taking the cruiser beyond the reach of shore batteries). HM Government's response was to reject the new limit, stating that outside of three miles Franco had no right to interfere with lawful trade (it was acceptable within the old limit) but Prime Minister Baldwin hoped the Red Ensign would not be found in these troubled waters telling any captain seeking to run the blockade ""it is impossible to protect them [merchant ships] who go into that area so long as conditions prevail"", nonetheless the Royal Navy would continue to patrol the Bay of Biscay.

GALERNA and ALMIRANTE CERVERA continued, largely unsuccessfully, with the blockade. Faced with merchant ships continuing to run the blockade Franco told the British Government that all such attempts ""would be resisted by insurgent warships by all possible means"". This had little impact on the trade: between the 1st and 20th of April 1937 thirty two ships docked at Bilbao.  

On the 23rd of April the Nationalist navy confronted three British vessels - MACGREGOR, HAMSTERLEY and STANBROOK - running to Bilbao and yet again Franco's forces had to contend with superior naval force this time rather than three destroyers it was battle cruiser HMS HOOD supported by destroyers FIREDRAKE and FORTUNE. HOOD was fast and carried massive 15"" guns; she had been designed in the aftermath of WW1 and was mean to ensure the continued global superiority of the Royal Navy.   So when the Spanish cruiser and the armed trawler intercepted the three vessels they found themselves confronted by massive fire-power.  Undeterred GALERNA went after the merchant steamer MACGREGOR, ordering her to stop.  This brought FIREDRAKE into action who trained her guns on the trawler.  GALERNA then found herself under attack from shore batteries and her master decided caution was needed and he pulled away to the North West.  ALMIRANTE CERVERA took up the battle and turner her guns on the merchant ships at which point HMS HOOD confronted the cruiser, not surprisingly the Nationalist ship backed off.  And so the British ships entered Bilbao as one observer put it they arrived ""to enormous crowds [who] cheered as the procession of three red dusters passed slowly up river"".  This was the 23rd of April.  Three days later much of the joy felt by the Basques was lost when the German Condor Legion bombed the town of Guernica.

On the 19th of June Franco's forces entered Bilbao. The long nightmare of his dictatorship was about to begin.  Between her encounter with HMS HOOD and the fall of the Basque Government GALERNA had continued the unholy fight indeed, the day before Bilbao fell she had engaged with the republican armed trawler GIPUZKOA which had survived the Battle of Matxitxako. Along with other vessel GIPUZKOA had sought refuge in Santona, near Santander; she was hit and her men abandoned ship, one seaman drowned. This was more or less the end of the Basque Auxiliary Navy.  GALERNA was retained as part of the Nationalist forces until 1939 and the final defeat of the Republic when she returned to her normal duties as a fishing boat.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 8/1/1886:
Court of session appeal against sheriff's judgement in case between James Craig, merchant, Aberdeen and Aberdeen and Glasgow Steam Shipping Co., over loss of linseed consigned to Craig in December 1883 voyage referred to above. Ship's owners claimed damage was caused by the perils of the sea. Craig argued that linseed used as fuel (value £60.14s.2d) was result of owners failing to load a sufficient quantity of coal and that a further £39.2s.3d worth of linseed was lost by water damage, shipowners having supplied insufficient dunnage (mats stowed under or among cargo to prevent moisture and chaffing), Craig argued shipowners were liable for these sums. He had paid part of the freight charge, £258.15.9, but had withheld £156.18.11, which shipowners were suing for. Decision was that shipowners had failed to show that losses of linseed were caused by perils of the sea, that they were liable for value of lost cargo and were only entitled to a reduced proportion of freight rate.

15 November 1870: On a voyage from Newcastle-upon-Tyne to Rio de Janeiro with a cargo of coal and unspecified goods the vessel foundered and was lost following a collision offshore.  In wind conditions NW Force 4, 7 miles South East of Whitby Lighthouse.

Dundee Courier: 18th November 1870:
Brig General Havelock, of Aberdeen, Capt. Watson, while on voyage from Newcastle to Rio de Janeiro with coals, was in collision off Flamborough Head.  It appears she was run into by brig Albert H. Locke of Littlehampton.
The Havelock soon filled and sank within 10 minutes.  The crew took to their boat, but the captain remained aboard until the vessel was about to sink, when he sprang off and was picked up after being a short time in the water by a boat from the other brig.  The men of the Havelock's boat were also taken aboard.  John Smith, seaman, a native of Edinburgh, who was drowned, is believed to have fallen into the water when the collision occurred while attempting to jump on board the Albert H. Locke.  Capt. Watson and the crew were landed at Bridlington by a fishing smack.  On arrival at Aberdeen Capt. Watson and the crew would give little information about the accident because, it is said, the matter is likely to be heard in a court of law.  The Havelock was one of the smartest brigs that hailed from the port of Aberdeen and owned by Mr William Milne, merchant, South Mount Street."

Belfast Newsletter, 28/07/1829:
'We regret to state total loss of brig George Canning, Stephen, of Aberdeen, on her voyage from Bay of Chalour (New Brunswick) to call at Aberdeen.  Vessel struck soon after midnight on 17th June a little to west of Cape Fine, on coast of Newfoundland, while running under double reefed topsails and so dreadfull was the shock as to present the most appalling prospect to the hapless crew.  The tremendous cliff under which the unfortunate vessel was thrown broadside, far over-topped the mastheads, while the main topgallant yardarm dashed against the rugged precipice.  The sea broke against the rocks with such violence as to threaten total wreck of vessel, which was already giving way.  Crew with utmost difficulty and danger succeeded in getting from the wreck in the long boat or skiff with only a bag of bread and some water.  Having with great exertion cleared the land, they providentially reached St Peter's River on east side of St Mary's Bay after being exposed for 38 hours to the greatest peril.'"

July 1820 - Left Tobermory with 141 passengers bound for Quebec. 18 landed at Quebec / 123 landed at Cape Breton.  Captain Murray.

December 1831: Stranded at Lochmaddy, slipped off and sank, a wreck, Capt Skeen.
(Source: 'Off Scotland' Ian Whittaker)

'August 1815, Master James Laird, 17 passengers were taken to Halifax and Pictou, Canada.
The Inverness Journal printed a commendation to Captain George Murray for his humane treatment and to the owners for the good quality of the provisions from four people who had made the crossing in July 1820, one of whom was John McRa a surgeon from Plockton.
When the GLENTANNER a 160-ton brig built in 1811 carried her seventeen passengers in 1817, they have been accommodated in a cabin area; but when in 1840 she took 140 immigrants from Tobermory to Cape Breton and Quebec in a single crossing, they travelled as steerage passengers. This number could only have been accommodated by placing temporary decking on crossbeams along the full length of the hold. Thus, before leaving Aberdeen for Tobermory, planks would have been laid and the sides of her hold would have been lined with wooden berths (or bunks). Then having disembarked her passengers, she would have returned to Aberdeen with her hold brimmed full of timber. This was to be the pattern of emigrant travel for the next thirty years or so'.

Dundee Courier, 26/12/1873:
Screw steamer GLOAMIN, Capt. McKechnie, expected to leave docks for Birkenhead with cargo of 3 large boilers, machinery and funnel for large steamer fitting out there. GLOAMIN'S hatches, large already, had to be lengthened and widened.

Dundee Courier, 1/2/1877:
Steamer GLOAMIN, on leaving Sunderland yesterday for Dundee, was dashed against the pier by a wave. Bow was damaged and she had to put back for repairs.

Western Mail, 22/12/1877:
Steamer GLOAMIN, Dundee-Calais with coal, ran ashore at Flamborough head during fog on 20 Dec. and filled with water. Tide has since flowed over her and she will probably become total wreck. Crew saved. Owned by R.A. Mudie & Sons, Dundee.

Dundee Courier, 26/12/1877:
Broke up Sunday evening; cargo a total loss, but a few stores saved.

Dundee Courier, 11/1/1878:
Board of Trade enquiry re loss of Dundee steamer GLOAMIN near Flam borough head 20 Dec. Capt. John Farrow gave evidence that he sailed on morning of 20 Dec., coal laden, for Calais. Weather was hazy all day. Sailing at about 8 knots, when he passed Flamborough he altered his course a point or two and thought that would carry him round Flamborough head. At 8:30pm he saw breakers and altered hi helm about 2 and a half points, but vessel only answered helm about a point and she struck about 1 and a half miles north of Flamborough head. Gun was supposed to be fired from Flamborough head in fog, but he heard none till half an hour later. In answer to question, he said no soundings were taken and fog lifted and fell periodically. William Anderson, second mate, corroborated master's statement, and said weather was thicker before vessel struck. David Mitchell, mate, was below. Mr. Pagaw on behalf of Board of Trade charged captain with having caused stranding of ship through unskilful and negligent navigation. Hearing adjourned."

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 21/9/1891:
About 1 o'clock Saturday afternoon the steamer GOLFER, built to order of Mr. Robert Thomson, Fenchurch St., London, was launched from yard of Messrs. J. Duthie & Sons, Aberdeen, in presence of a goodly number of spectators. Mrs. J.A. Duthie gracefully performed christening ceremony and vessel glided smoothly into the water accompanied by loud cheering. After launch a number of friends of the owners and builders met in Duthie's office and drank success to the new steamer. She is to be supplied with triple expansion engines and other fittings of the most approved style for cargo carrying. Will be towed to Dundee to have her engines fitted by Messrs. Gourlay.

Dundee Courier, 26/9/1891:
Arrived 25 Sept. to have engines and boilers fitted.

Northern Echo, 5/1/1892:
GOLFER, steamer, St. Valery to Ellesmere, anchored in Mersey, was fouled by VILLE DE BELFERT and had bows damaged.

Glasgow Herald, 25/1/1892:
Before Greenock local marine board, Capt. John B. Higham charged with having been under influence of drink on screw steamer GOLFER on voyage London to Harve when she grounded on Goodwin Sands, remained for 3 hours, but got off unharmed. Claimed he only had glass or two whiskies because he was unwell. Court found hum guilty, but as his first offence after holding excellent certificate for over 20 years, let him go with admonition with hope he would give up dangerous practice of taking too much strong drink.

Freeman's Journal, 6/3/1896:
Steamer GOLFER, Capt. Bandaine, bound for West Port, Co. Mayo, from London with cargo of manure, arrived in Kilrush harbour for repairs, having experienced full force of recent violent gales. Vessel is short of provisions and coals, and bulwarks, sails and deck fittings were carried away and pipes to steam steering gear damaged. Reported several of crew received severe injuries.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 20/8/1896:
Steamer GOLFER, of London, was steaming down Aberdeen harbour to dock gates when it collided with tug WILLIE FINDLAY lying at Provost Matthew's Quay. After getting clear of one tug she ran against another, GRANITW CITY, berthed on north side of gates. WILLIE FINDLAY received serious damage to stem, GRANITE CITY considerably damaged amidships. GOLFER had three plates stove in on port side and was damaged amidships. The cause is not very clear at present, but captain of GOLFER says WILLIE FINDLAY was adrift and blocking passage. Another version is that WILLIE FINDLAY slipped from her moorings after collision.

Glasgow Herald, 30/10/1896:
Telegram from Copenhagen says steamer GOLFER has been floated.

On taking steps to land the spar, the landing waiter objected to allow it to be placed on this wharf or even to pass over the ship's side into the water so that it could be towed to the shipbuilder's yard, a short distance away, until the new impost was paid [about £14].

""GRANITE CITY."" 

The Merchant Shipping Acts, 1854 to 1876. 

IN the matter of the formal Investigation held at Westminster on the 3rd and 4th of January 1882, before H. C. ROTHERY, Esquire, Wreck Commissioner, assisted by Captain BEASLEY and Captain RONALDSON as Assessors, into the circumstances attending the abandonment of the British sailing ship ""GRANITE CITY,"" of London, on the 22nd of November last, whilst on her voyage from Dalhousie in New Brunswick to London. 

Report of Court. 

The Court, having carefully inquired into the circumstances of the above-mentioned shipping casualty, finds, for the reasons annexed, that the loss of the said vessel ""Granite City"" was due to the violent gales which she encountered in the Atlantic, and which, owing partly to her age, partly to the weight of cargo which she had on board, she was not able to resist, and that the master and crew did all in their power to save her, and that they were justified in abandoning her when they did. 

The Court is not asked to make any order as to costs. 

Dated this 4th day of January 1882.

H. C. ROTHERT, Wreck Commissioner. 

We concur in the above report.

Annex to the Report. 

This case was heard at Westminster on the 3rd and 4th of January instant, when Mr. Middleton appeared for the Board of Trade. The owners and the master of the ""Granite City"" were present, but were not represented by either counsel or solicitor. Eight witnesses having been produced by the Board of Trade and examined, Mr. Middleton handed in a statement of the questions on which the Board of Trade desired the opinion of the Court. The managing owner of the ""Granite City"" having recalled the master, then addressed the Court on behalf of himself and his co-owner, and Mr. Middleton having been heard in reply, the Court proceeded to give judgment on the questions on which its opinion had been asked. The facts of the case, so far as they are undisputed, are as follow:â€"" 

The ""Granite City,"" which was a wooden barque, belonging to the Port of London, of 771 tons gross and 726 tons net, was built at Aberdeen in the year 1853, and at the time of her loss was the property of Mr. Joseph Parson and of Mr. Robert Alexander Stewart, of No. 3, Fen Court, in the City of London, Mr. Stewart being the managing owner. She left Dalhousie in New Brunswick on Saturday the 12th November last, bound to London, with a crew of 14 hands all told, and a cargo of 300 to 310 standards of deals, including the deck load. The crew at first would not do any work, but on the master refusing to give them anything to eat unless they did so, they on the following day returned to their duty under circumstances which we shall presently have to detail at length. For the first few days they had moderate breezes from the N.W., but on the 15th the wind began to freshen, and on the 16th it blew a hard gale varying from S.W. to N.W. During that night the vessel laboured a good deal, and on finding on the following morning that the deck load had started, the master deemed it prudent to jettison it, and on this being done the vessel rode more easily. On the same day the standard of the windmill pump broke, and they had to work the deck pumps, but on the windmill pump being repaired it was found sufficient to keep the vessel free. On the 18th the gale moderated, but on the 19th it began to blow again, and the vessel was accordingly hove to on the starboard tack. During that day the lower main topsail was blown away, and on the following morning, it being found that four of the stanchions on the port and two on the starboard side had started, and that the oakum had worked out, the master stopped up the holes with oakum, and the weather having moderated they bent a new lower main topsail. At about 8 o'clock the same evening the gale recommenced, and at 2 of the following morning the lower main topsail blew away again. Between 5 and 6, the captain observing that the vessel was dipping her port quarter very heavily, and that she seemed to be very stagnant in the water, ordered the second mate to sound the well, and on his doing so it was found that there were 16 feet of water in the hold. All hands were accordingly called to man the pumps, but as the sea was making a clean breach over her, it was found impossible to stand to them. Accordingly the captain, feeling certain that the vessel would be soon water-logged, ordered water and provisions to be carried up into the main and mizen tops; and at about 8.30, the cabin beginning to be flooded, they all took to the rigging. After a time some wreckage was observed to be coming from under the port quarter, and shortly afterwards the decks began to lift, upon which the master, fearing that the ship was breaking up under them, ordered the boats to be got ready. During the night the wind and sea moderated, and they were able to remain on the fore part of the deck. The next morning, however, it was observed that the port side of the vessel from the main rigging aft had come away both planks and timbers as low down as the main deck, and that it was trailing alongside; and the sail of a vessel, which proved to be the ""David Taylor,"" having shortly afterwards hove in sight, all hands got into the lifeboat, and having pulled towards her, they were taken on board, and were brought safely to and landed in this country. We are told that when the vessel was abandoned she was in about latitude 44Â° 39' north, and about longitude 38Â§ west, or about 300 miles to the east of Newfoundland; and there can be little doubt that she has long since foundered. 

Now the first question upon which our opinion has been asked is, ""Whether, when the ""Granite City"" left Dalhousie on the 12th of November last, she was in good and seaworthy condition?"" This, as Mr. Middleton truly observed, is perhaps the most important question in this inquiry; and before answering it, it may be well to give a brief history of the vessel. She was, as I have already said, built at Aberdeen in the year 1853, and was originally classed A 1 at Lloyd's for 10 years; whether on the expiration of that time her class was renewed we are not told, but in 1870 she was restored to her original class for 7 years, and on the expiration of that time she was continued in the same class for 5 years more, which would bring her down to 1882. In April of last year Mr. Parson, who had owned 16/64th parts of her since 1874 or 1875, purchased in addition 20 shares, thus increasing his interest to 36/64th parts, the remaining 28/64th parts being at the same time bought by Mr. Stewart. Having done some repairs to her at Cardiff, the owners then sent her to St. John's, New Brunswick, where Mr. Stewart has a branch house, and where she was thoroughly repaired at an expense of 833l.; and having then been surveyed by Lloyd's surveyor at that place, she was reported fit to be continued in the first class. On the completion of the repairs the vessel took in a cargo of deals, with which she sailed for Faversham, and having there discharged her cargo returned in ballast to Dalhousie, where she took in the cargo with which she sailed on her last voyage. It seems that the crew who had brought the vessel to Faversham had been engaged at St. John's for the voyage to this country and back again to New Brunswick; accordingly, on the vessel's arrival at Dalhousie, all, with the exception of two men who had been shipped in England, left her, and it became necessary to hire a fresh crew. Eight new hands were accordingly engaged at St. John's, and were sent by rail in two batches to join the ship at Dalhousie. The first batch, which consisted of 5 men, joined her on the 6th or 7th, the other three on the 11th, the day before she sailed, and of these three have been produced before us, one belonging to the first and two to the second batch it would seem that as soon as the men saw the vessel they took a dislike to her, and determined not to go in her; they were not able to specify any defect which would render her unseaworthy, but they said that she looked old, and that they thought that she would not carry them safely across the Atlantic. The men were to have had thirty dollars each for the run to this country, and of this the first batch had had twenty dollars each advanced to them, and the second batch fifteen, all of which had actually gone to the boarding-house keepers. Under these circumstances the master was very unwilling to let them go ashore, fearing to lose them, but he told them that he was willing to have a survey on the ship; this, however, the men declined, saying that they wanted to be taken before a magistrate. On the 11th the master brought three surveyors on board, namely, a shipbuilder, the port warden, and a pilot, and these gentlemen having reported that the vessel was not making any water to speak of, and that she was ""a "" good and substantial vessel in every way, and "" adapted for the trade"" in which she was engaged, the master determined to sail whether the men liked it or not. Accordingly early on the morning of the 12th a gang of men came on board and got the anchor up and the vessel under weigh, and she proceeded to sea, the 8 hands refusing to lend a hand. The men still refusing to do duty, the master told them that he should not give them any food, and at length on the following day, being starved out, they went to work again. I have said that the men were not able to specify anything which would be likely to make the vessel unseaworthy; they complained indeed that the forecastle was too small for ten men, upon which the captain told them that he would berth two of them in the carpenter's shop; they also said that there was no stove in the forecastle; but neither of these things would render the vessel unseaworthy. Flannigan indeed, one of the men, stated that the decks were not in good condition; but in this he was not supported by the others. They admitted that the sails and rigging and pumps were good, and all that they could say against her was that she was old, that they did not like her, and that they did not think she would carry them safely across the Atlantic. On the other hand the master, who had been in her since she had been bought by her late owners in April last, and who had made the voyage from Cardiff to St. John's, thence with a cargo to Faversham, and back again to Dalhousie, as well as the chief officer who had joined her at Faversham, stated that, although old, she was in their opinion a good vessel, and they shewed their confidence in her seaworthiness by going in her even with a very unwilling crew. We were told also by Mr. Parson, who had acted as broker for the vessel since 1870, that up to the last year she had been regularly engaged in the East India trade, bringing rice and cotton from Madras and sugar from Java, and that since he has had a share in her they had never made a claim on the underwriters. He told us also that they had spent in repairs upon her 445l. at Belfast in April 1878; 500l. in caulking and remetalling her at New York in 1879; 163l. at Greenock in May 1880; 111l. at Cardiff in 1881, besides the 833l. spent upon her in June and July last at St. John's, New Brunswick. Taking all these circumstances into consideration, the fact that such large sums had been spent upon her within the last few years, that only in July last she had been apparently opened up, and put into a thorough state of repair at a very large expense, that she had been so recently surveyed by Lloyd's surveyors, and was in the first class at Lloyd's, and that she had until the last year carried dry and valuable cargoes from the East Indies without damage, and without any claim upon the underwritersâ€""taking all these circumstances into consideration we should have been disposed to think that the men must have been mistaken as to her being unseaworthy, were it not for what subsequently occurred, and for the way she seems to have broken up under their feet. It appears to the assessors that if she had been in a good and seaworthy condition when she left Dalhousie, she would not have broken up as she did, and that there must have been some radical defects, which were not apparent to the surveyors, and which rendered her unfit to encounter the gales which might naturally be expected at that season of the year in crossing the Atlantic, and which a good seaworthy ship would have been able to resist. We are therefore not prepared to say that, when she left Dalhousie on the 12th of November last, she was in a thoroughly good and seaworthy condition. 

The next question upon which our opinion is asked is, ""What freeboard had she, and was such freeboard sufficient?"" On this point the evidence is, perhaps, not very satisfactory; according to the master and chief officer the Plimsoll mark when they left Dalhousie was very near awash, and that to the best of their belief would give her a freeboard of about 4 feet or 4 feet 6 inches. Now a freeboard of 54 inches on a depth of hold of 20.2 feet would give less than 2 3/4 inches to every foot depth of hold, which the assessors think would hardly be sufficient for a vessel of her age crossing the Atlantic at that season of the year. They think that 300 to 310 standards of deals, which it seems she had on board, was a very heavy cargo for her, and that under the circumstances she should not have had less than three inches of freeboard to every foot depth of hold. 

The third question upon which our opinion has been asked is, ""Whether the load-line was obliterated?"" According to the mater the Plimsoll mark was quite distinct when the vessel left Dalhousie; he told us that there was a copper disc on the vessel's side to indicate the position of the Plimsoll mark, and that it had been painted white when the repairs were being done in June or July of last year. He admitted, however, that on the last voyage out they had black varnished the top sides, and that the tar might have run down over the disc; and, if so, it is quite possible that the rafts and lighters which came alongside might by rubbing against it have spread it over the plate and so obliterated the mark. The chief mate also said that the Plimsoll mark was visible, but he could not tell us what colour it was; he inclined, however, to think that it was black, and that it had been painted over; but if so, the side of the vessel being black, it would hardly have been visible. The boatswain, or acting second mate, who joined the ship at Dalhousie on the 7th, told us that he did not remember to have seen the Plimsoll mark at all; and the three A.B's also say that they did not see it. On the whole, seeing that one of the first things that a seaman looks for when he joins a ship is the position of the Plimsoll mark, to see if she is more deeply laden than she should be, we are disposed to think that if the mark was not wholly obliterated it was not so distinctly marked on the vessel's sides as the Act seems to require. 

The fourth question that we are asked is, ""Whether she carried too heavy a deck load, having regard to the structural strength of the vessel?"" According to the master she had from 15 to 18 standards of deals on deck. For a good strong vessel that would not be an excessive amount, and, as Mr. Middleton has truly remarked, the deck load had been jettisoned before the vessel sustained any of the injuries which led to her loss. At the same time the assessors are disposed to doubt whether an old vessel like this, 28 years old, ought when crossing the Atlantic to have had any deck load at all at that season of the year. 

The fifth question upon which our opinion is asked is, ""What was the height of the deck load, and did it exceed 3 feet?"" According to the seamen the deck load was from 3 feet to 3 1/2 feet high, but they were not prepared to swear that it was more than 3 feet high. According to the captain, the chief mate, and the boatswain, the after-part extending from the break of the poop to the after-end of the deck house was nine deals high, whilst forward of this they were only six deals high; this would give, assuming the deals to have been 3 inches each, 27 inches for the after-part and 18 inches for the fore-part. As, however, New Brunswick deals are, we are told, ordinarily 3 1/4 to 3 1/2 inches thick, it would make the after-part of the deck load some 30 to 32 inches high, and the fore-part 19 to 20 inches; but there is no evidence to show that at any part it exceeded 3 feet. 

The sixth question upon which our opinion is asked is, ""Whether the deck load was properly secured?"" All the witnesses, except Flannigan, stated that the deck load was properly secured with chains and ropes, but we are not disposed to place any reliance on his evidence, as he was not confirmed on that point by any of the other witnesses. That it subsequently got adrift is no proof that it had not been properly secured, for I am told that this often happens in crossing the Atlantic during tempestuous weather such as that which this vessel encountered. 

The seventh question that we are asked is, ""Whether the master was justified in taking the protesting seamen to sea against their will?"" it is quite clear that the men were unwilling to go to sea in her, and would rather have been sent to prison, and that they asked to be taken before a magistrate. Under these circumstances, and looking at the 243rd section of the Act of 1854 and at the 7th section of the Act of 1871, which prescribes the mode in which a master should act when his crew refuse to go to sea, there can be no doubt whatever that the master was not justified in taking them to sea against their wills, but he should have taken them before a magistrate. At the same time we are ready to admit that great allowance must be made for him, as the winter was coming on and there was a fear of the vessel being frozen in, and in the event of the men being sent to prison by the magistrates there might have been great difficulty in obtaining substitutes for them. On the whole, although the master was not justified in taking them to sea against their wills, we think that great allowances must be made for him. 

The eighth question upon which our opinion is asked is, ""What was the cause of the vessel making so much water on the morning of the 21st of November?"" It would seem from the evidence that the water came in on the port quarter and below the level of the cabin floor. We are told that the vessel had a long projecting counter, and as she rolled this would necessarily strike the water with great force, and the deeper she was the greater would be the force with which it would strike. It seems to the assessors that some of the butts or hood ends may have been started by the repeated blows which she received under the counter, and that thus the water got into the vessel. 

The ninth question that we are asked is, ""What was the cause of the breaking up of the vessel?"" That the decks should have begun to lift when the vessel became waterlogged is perhaps not surprising, but that the side of the vessel from the main rigging aft to the stern post should have opened, not the planks only, but the timbers also being carried away, shews in the opinion of the assessors that there must have been something very faulty in that part. The boatswain on being asked the question saidâ€""""I should think that the timbers must "" have been old and pretty rotten for the planks to "" come away in that way;"" and in that opinion the ??ors are disposed to concur. The cause of the vessel breaking up as she did was in their opinion due to her being very old and to the heavy cargo which she had on board, rendering it impossible for her to contend against such weather as she might naturally expect in crossing the Atlantic at that season of the year, and which a stronger vessel would have been able to resist. 

The tenth question upon which our opinion is asked is, ""Whether all proper efforts were made to save the ship?"" In our opinion they were. Nothing that the master and crew could have done could possibly have saved her. 

The eleventh question that we are asked is, ""Whether the vessel was navigated with proper and seamanlike care?"" In our opinion she was. We were told by the chief officer that he had served in her 17 years ago, and that when they got into bad weather the vessel took so much water on deck that they found that they would run her, and that it was necessary to heave her to. In bringing, therefore, the vessel to when the wind and sea became heavy, the master seems to have taken a proper course. 

The twelfth question is, ""Whether she was prematurely abandoned?"" We think not. The vessel was evidently fast breaking up when they took to the lifeboat, and had they remained much longer in her they would probably have gone down with her. 

The last question which we are asked is, ""Whether the master and officers are or either of them is in default, and whether blame attaches to any other person for the casualty?"" And it is added that ""the Board of Trade are "" of opinion that the certificate of the master should be "" dealt with."" In having taken the men to sea against their wills, and perhaps also in having put so heavy a cargo in her, well knowing that she was a very old ship, and that they were about to cross the Atlantic in midwinter, when they might reasonably expect to encounter some very severe gales, we think that the master was somewhat to blame. Seeing, however, that this last point has not been very strongly pressed against him by the learned counsel for the Board of Trade, who stated that the application to deal with his certificate was made rather as a matter of form; considering also that the vessel had recently been repaired at a heavy expense, and that she had a first class at Lloyd's; that those facts were well known to the master, and that whatever defects she may have had escaped the observation not only of Lloyd's surveyors, but of the three surveyors called in to inspect her on the day before her departure, we are not disposed to deal with his certificate; nor does it appear to us that any blame attaches to any of the other officers of the vessel. As regards the owners, there is in our opinion nothing to shew that they are in any way to blame for this casualty, for they seem to have done everything in their power to send her to sea in a good and seaworthy condition. I may add that, although Mr. Parson had insured his 36/64th shares of her in the sum of 950l., which we are told was very considerably less than its value, Mr. Stewart, the managing owner, and the owner of the remaining 28/64ths, the owner also of the cargo which she had on board, and which had been sold to arrive for 1,700l., was wholly uninsured. It has been said that this Court has no right to inquire whether an owner's interest is or is not insured, and whether to the full value or not, but I cannot concur in that opinion. It appears to me that if in the course of one of these inquiries it should transpire that the owner had greatly over-insured the value of his interest in the vessel, that fact would no doubt be strongly pressed against him if there was reason to think that she had been wilfully or negligently cast away. On the other hand, if an owner is wholly uninsured, and is a considerable loser by the casualty, it may fairly be taken as some evidence of his bona fides. On the whole there is nothing to show that the owners were in any way to blame for this casualty. 

The Court was not asked to make any order as to costs.

Aberdeen Journal, 10/1/1872:
From Overland China Mail, 25/11/1871: We are glad to welcome the new steamer HAI LOONG as addition to mercantile fleet of these waters, a second edition on a small scale, of well known steamer KWANG TUNG, intended for the Formosa trade. Steam vessels now making gradual but certain inroads in every branch of sea carrying trade. HAI LOONG and similar steamers under construction likely to prove most powerful competitors to the small sailing vessels which have previously monopolised the trade between island of Formosa and neighbouring Chinese ports. From her satisfactory trial trip from Aberdeen to Hong Kong, we should think her pre-eminently well adapted for trade for which she has been built. From start point to Port Said she was 15 days; from Port Said to Singapore direct only 25 and a half days. She made rather a long passage from there to Hong Kong, but this owing to very steady NE monsoon. She is well fitted in every way for foreign and native passengers and is commanded by Capt. Farlow. As to her construction and machinery, enough to say they are work of well known firm of Hall Russell and Co. of the Granite City."

They then got out the boat and pulled to a small island, and went aboard again the next day to get provisions and water, before starting for the island of Fines, on third day afterwards they were picked up by Constantine. The hull of Hannibal was still whole, but the masts had gone over the side when the captain left. All hands saved.

Daily News, 14/12/1854:
Advice from Sydney 20 September of arrival of French Corvette CONSTANTINE with Capt. and Mrs Walker and crew of clipper ship HANNIBAL which sailed from Sydney for China July 28.  Capt. Walker states that on 3 August the ship struck on a reef off New Caledonia, about 20 miles to the southward of Port St. Vincent.  She soon after fell upon her beam ends.  The boats were immediately hauled out, provisions put in and the crew pulled to a small island inside the reef.  The day after the French authorities came down and rendered every assistance in their power.  A considerable quantity of sails and provisions were saved, the sails being sold.  Capt. Walker attributes the loss of his vessel to a current running at 3 m.p.h. 3 years before he had been in the same track, but did not experience any current. When he left the ship her main and mizzen masts were gone and she would probably soon break up. She is partly insured.

Ship Harlaw, from London to Melbourne, has been spoken on the line [Equator] dismasted. The captain declined to accept any assistance.

Melbourne Argus, 4/8/1875:
Ship Harlaw, Captain Stephens, which arrived in Sydney from London on 28 July 1875, reported that on 3 May in ""49.11 N, 8.50 W"" (in Western Approaches), she was in collision with Norwegian brig Prosperite. Harlaw was close hauled on starboard tack head Southwest. Brig was heading about East by South and heading apparently for the ship's waist. Suddenly, the brig put her helm up for purpose of crossing Harlaw's bows, instead of going under her stern - result was that the ship struck the brig on port quarter, carrying away upper portion of stern frame. The ship's jib-boom and head gear were carried away. The wore ship, thinking assistance might be required, found the brig had lowered her boat and crew and were leaving her. The captain of the brig reported his crew refused to stay by the ship because wheel chains and stauncheons had been carried away. The crew of Prosperite delayed Harlaw by four days. It would appear Prosperite had no lookout and only a lad at the wheel.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 25/09/1878:
Particulars from G. Thompson, Jun. and Co. re wreck of ship HARLAW near Shanghai 31st July.  At 3am a pilot was taken aboard and ship got underway up the river.  About breakfast time she struck heavily, with wind freshening to a gale more sail was spread, but instead of taking the ship off she listed heavily to port and the boats were ordered out.  All of the men in the dingy, which was the first to leave, were drowned except 2. 2 of the men in the long boat were washed overboard, the remainder reaching House Island and being taken to Shanghai next day by a Chinese junk.  A court of enquiry has exonerated Captain and officers of all blame, but pilot has been suspended.  Names of those drowned are:- George Cowie, Steward, Aberdeen; John Doig, London; A. Dalgairn, ordinary seaman, Aberdeen; George Littlejohn, D.S., Aberdeen; Coppel and Parker, 2 seamen shipped at Sydney; apprentices Mitchell, Crombie and Black, all Aberdeen.
North China Morning Post gives this account of wreck of dingy:-
William Buyers, 2nd Officer, was ordered by Capt. Stephens to take charge of dingy. Only he and able seaman Thomas Lawrie are saved (seven including the 3 apprentices were drowned from dingy).  Buyers interviewed by our reported said ""about noon we pulled towards the ship, I swam to it and got the jib sheet and a box of Indian corn flour.  At sundown we made the lightship, but was unable to fetch her.  Between 10 and 11 o'clock at night she shipped a sea filling her to the thwarts and the boat went down.  Most of men climbed on the upturned boat and every time she rolled one or two would be missed.  I was in the water and gripped by the Steward. My trouer leg tore away and I did not see the Steward again.  I came to the surface and found the boat with only one man, able seaman Thomas Lawrie, still there.  About 5 in the morning Lawrie was washed off.  I swam to him and with difficulty got him back to the boat, which we managed to get upright and get inside.  It was very rough.  Lawrie was again washed out and again I got him back.  About an hour before sundown we attracted the attention of a junk by waving a plank from the bottom of the boat.  The junk took us aboard and fed us, we having been away from the ship with nothing to eat or drink since about 9.30 the previous morning"".

HAWTHORN and HIBISCUS
Following the recent completion of NORTHELLA, Britain's largest stern fishing all-freezer trawler, Hall, Russell & Company Limited have completed and handed over two of the smallest twin deck stern trawlers ever built.
The HAWTHORN and HIBISCUS, which have been built for Irvin & Johnson Ltd., of Cape Town, South Africa, are only 140'-6"" in overall length which is 105'-0"" shorter than NORTHELLA.
HAWTHORN was handed over at the end of December 1964 and HIBISCUS in March 1965.  Both vessels were subject to extensive trials before delivery and the following is an extract from the report on the HAWTHORN:
""As in the case of the first stern trawler built by Hall Russell, the builders conducted extensive fishing trials to satisfy themselves that the vessel would handle and perform efficiently before she is handed over to her owners.  These trials were carried out in an area north of the Shetland Islands, in seas which were the result of several days of severe gale force winds, and shooting and hauling tests were carried out in varying depths up to 300 fathoms.  The vessel performed excellently under these adverse conditions, and the builders are well satisfied that she will cope with the difficult conditions in South African waters where fishing is carried out at great depth, and frequently in very heavy seas.  To ensure that the vessel was given a thorough and fair trial, the builders obtained the services of a skipper and crew from the firm of J. Marr & Son Limited, Hull, with whom they had already co-operated in building the stern trawlers JUNELLA and NORTHELLA.
Although the skipper had never previously handled a stern trawler, and only the mate had been on a stern trawler before, the trawl was shot and hauled in the difficult conditions prevailing with the greatest of ease by a crew of five, and all observers on board, who included Mr. A. Kay, Marine Superintendent of the Owners, Mr. Andrew Marr of J. Marr & Son, Hull, and Skippers George and Sanders from South Africa, were very impresed with the performance of the vessel.
Following delivery at Cape Town, representatives of Hall, Russell & Company Limited will complete their researches into the performance of this prototype vessel by making a fishing trip to the South African grounds, as it is only by first-hand study of the performance of new vessels in service that advances in design and the employment of new techniques become possible"".
HAWTHORN and HIBISCUS are sister-ships and the principal particulars are length overall 140'-6"", breadth 31'-0"" and depth 14'-3"".
The bridge, which has clear vision both fore and aft, is fitted with controls for the main engines which enable variations in engine speed and propeller pitch to be made and the clutch to be engaged and disengaged.  The navigational aids comprise a reflector type standard compass, an auxiliary compass, a Marconi radio-telephone, direction finder, echo sounder and fish-lup.  Underneath the bridge are cabins for Owner and Skipper.
The vessel is fitted with two complete decks all fore and aft.  On the upper deck, the bridge house is placed well forward which allows a long clear deck for handling the trawl.
Abaft the bridge the 4-barrel trawl winch is situated under the boat deck, which gives complete protection from sun and weather to the winch operators.
Two gallows type masts are fitted, the forward one for the purpose of hauling the cod end up the stern ramp, and the after one for spilling the bag of fish through the power operated deck hatch into the tween deck space below.
At the after end of the vessel a carefully designed gantry carries the hanging blocks, an ""A"" bracket and the other gear for shooting the trawl.
On the lower deck, working space is provided where the fish are gutted and headed, and then passed through a fish washing tank and conveyor chute straight into the fish hold below.  Forward of the working space are the officers' and crew's mess rooms, the galley and crew accommodation, all of which is mechanically ventilated to give comfortable conditions in the tropics. Below this deck, the engine room is at the forward end of the vessel and abaft this are the offal and fish holds.  A shaft tunnel is carried under the fish hold, and ballast and fresh water tanks are fitted at the tunnel sides.  The fish holds are lined with fibreglass insulation, which is sheathed with heavy aluminium plating, and all fish posts, boards and divisions are of aluminium.
In the engine room,  the main propusion unit has been provided by W.H. Allen Sons & Co. Ltd., of Bedford, and comprises an 8 cylinder pressure charged marine diesel engine with a bore of 325 mm and a stroke of 370 mm clutch coupled through a Lohmann & Stolterfoht marine reduction gear to a Liaaen controllable pitch propeller.  On this gearbox, two layshafts are fitted to drive the winch generator and a 44 kilowatt D.C. auxiliary generator.  Auxiliaries comprise a 5 cylinder Ruston & Hornsby diesel engine, coupled to a 40 kw. generator and a Hamworthy compressor of 18 1/2 cubic feet per minute capacity.  A small diesel driven Hamworthy air compressor is also provided.  The main pumps in the engine room are of Hamworthy make and the smaller pumps are by Mono.
On measured mile trials a speed of 13 knots was achieved.

HAWTHORN was given a new name in 1989 to OCEAN DAWN, owned by Natal Ocean Ltd. Cape Town, South Africa.

Sold 2002/2003 to Deskar Distributors Durban and renamed AFRICAN STAR.  2 compartment holds were created to hold shrimp.  In Regiter until 2008"

Whilst sailing under Captain Theodore Bastholm, from Sydney to Newcastle HEATH ran onto a reef and was wrecked at Cape Three Points, Broken Bay, New South Wales, Australia on the 4th January 1889.  One or two crew drowned.

Sydney Morning Herald and Newcastle Morning Herald, 08/01/1889:
'Schooner Heath left Sydney 28/12/1888 for Newcastle in ballast, Master Thomas Bastholm, who held certificate as coasting master, had been in trade for 8 years, but on Heath for only month and half. Vessel was in coal trade Newcastle - Port Jackson, owned by Mr B. Byrnes of Sydney. On 29th Dec. she was 10 miles south of Newcastle, wind came in strong from North East and vessel was forced to run back to Broken Bay for shelter, remaining there till 3/1/1889; when worst of weather seemed past and she sailed. After passing Baran Joey Lighthouse weather became thick and rainy and master set course he thought would keep her well clear of land. At 1 a.m. 4/1/1889 vessel without warning struck on a rock off Cape Three Points, a mile from shore: when she was under full canvas. After bumping on the rock she filled and mainmast went overboard with terrific crash, taking a boat with it. Master got the big boat over the side, but decided to stand by the ship until daylight. One man, Ohlsen, jumped into the boat, took her away and was not seen again. A huge wave carried the deckhouse over the side. Some men were washed off the deck, others off the deckhouse as it was driven towards land.

The other two ships were the CLANSMAN 911 and COLUMBA 912 which was still operating in 2010 as the HEBRIDEAN PRINCESS.  The ferries were built as side loading car ferries with a ramp and lift forward of the bridge front and twin propellers aft.

Most information from:
Deayton, Alistair, CalMac: An Illustrated History of Caledonian MacBrayne (Chalford: Amberley Publishing, 2015)

Throughout her Western Isles career (1964-85) Hebrides was employed on Uig (Skye) | Tarbet (Harris) | Lochmaddy (North Uist).
Service: She proved very reliable except in 1981, when she lost a rudder and was towed to Greenock for replacement. It had to be manufactured and she did not return in service until 1 July, having been off duty for a month. 
One of her most unusual 'passengers' was in Sept. 1980, when she carried from Lochmaddy to Uig the (at that time) celebrated grizzly bear Hercules, which had been loose in N. Uist for 3 weeks [Liverpool Echo, 17/09/1980].
In 1979 the crew presented a retiring pier worker at Uig with a silver tea set to thank him for awaiting the arrival of the ship regardless of the weather for 9 years [Press + Journal, 27/11/1979].
In 1981 Highland Regional Council awarded a contract for removing silt from the berth used by Hebrides at Uig [Press + Journal, 14/05/1981].
The most frequent diversions by Hebrides from her normal roster were to make livestock sailings, usually, to Oban - from Lochboisdale, Castlebay, Lochmaddy, Tiree, Coll and Colonsay.
For her last 4 years in CalMac service she was laid up at Greenock in late winter, usually for 2 months. She made her final CalMac sailings on 13 Nov. 1985 and was sold to Torbay Seaways for planned service from Torquay to Channel Islands.

Daily News, 08/11/1853:
Schooner HEROINE sailed from London about 18 months ago on a trading voyage to Africa, her owner Captain Cormack being master. He traded with the King of Tabout on credit, to be paid for in palm oil, etc., and having failed to receive this, took the King and some of his people and kept them on the vessel.  The King's son and subjects came out in canoes and boarded the vessel.  Capt. Cormack was stabbed from behing and pitched overboard and remainder of crew except one boy were murdered.  2 days later the brig TWEED chanced to anchor there and paid the natives to give up the HEROINE.  The ship was brought home with difficulty by Capt. Stafford, being dismasted in a heavy gale near the Western Isles.

Aberdeen Journal, 23/11/1853:
Treacherously murdered by the natives of Tabou, West Africa, on 11 July aboard the schooner HEROINE, Captain Daniel Cormack of Wick, age 39.

HAWTHORN and HIBISCUS
Following the recent completion of NORTHELLA, Britain's largest stern fishing all-freezer trawler, Hall, Russell & Company Limited have completed and handed over two of the smallest twin deck stern trawlers ever built.
The HAWTHORN and HIBISCUS, which have been built for Irvin & Johnson Ltd., of Cape Town, South Africa, are only 140'-6"" in overall length which is 105'-0"" shorter than NORTHELLA.
HAWTHORN was handed over at the end of December 1964 and HIBISCUS in March 1965.  Both vessels were subject to extensive trials before delivery and the following is an extract from the report on the HAWTHORN:
""As in the case of the first stern trawler built by Hall Russell, the builders conducted extensive fishing trials to satisfy themselves that the vessel would handle and perform efficiently before she is handed over to her owners.  These trials were carried out in an area north of the Shetland Islands, in seas which were the result of several days of severe gale force winds, and shooting and hauling tests were carried out in varying depths up to 300 fathoms.  The vessel performed excellently under these adverse conditions, and the builders are well satisfied that she will cope with the difficult conditions in South African waters where fishing is carried out at great depth, and frequently in very heavy seas.  To ensure that the vessel was given a thorough and fair trial, the builders obtained the services of a skipper and crew from the firm of J. Marr & Son Limited, Hull, with whom they had already co-operated in building the stern trawlers JUNELLA and NORTHELLA.
Although the skipper had never previously handled a stern trawler, and only the mate had been on a stern trawler before, the trawl was shot and hauled in the difficult conditions prevailing with the greatest of ease by a crew of five, and all observers on board, who included Mr. A. Kay, Marine Superintendent of the Owners, Mr. Andrew Marr of J. Marr & Son, Hull, and Skippers George and Sanders from South Africa, were very impresed with the performance of the vessel.
Following delivery at Cape Town, representatives of Hall, Russell & Company Limited will complete their researches into the performance of this prototype vessel by making a fishing trip to the South African grounds, as it is only by first-hand study of the performance of new vessels in service that advances in design and the employment of new techniques become possible"".
HAWTHORN and HIBISCUS are sister-ships and the principal particulars are length overall 140'-6"", breadth 31'-0"" and depth 14'-3"".
The bridge, which has clear vision both fore and aft, is fitted with controls for the main engines which enable variations in engine speed and propeller pitch to be made and the clutch to be engaged and disengaged.  The navigational aids comprise a reflector type standard compass, an auxiliary compass, a Marconi radio-telephone, direction finder, echo sounder and fish-lup.  Underneath the bridge are cabins for Owner and Skipper.
The vessel is fitted with two complete decks all fore and aft.  On the upper deck, the bridge house is placed well forward which allows a long clear deck for handling the trawl.
Abaft the bridge the 4-barrel trawl winch is situated under the boat deck, which gives complete protection from sun and weather to the winch operators.
Two gallows type masts are fitted, the forward one for the purpose of hauling the cod end up the stern ramp, and the after one for spilling the bag of fish through the power operated deck hatch into the tween deck space below.
At the after end of the vessel a carefully designed gantry carries the hanging blocks, an ""A"" bracket and the other gear for shooting the trawl.
On the lower deck, working space is provided where the fish are gutted and headed, and then passed through a fish washing tank and conveyor chute straight into the fish hold below.  Forward of the working space are the officers' and crew's mess rooms, the galley and crew accommodation, all of which is mechanically ventilated to give comfortable conditions in the tropics. Below this deck, the engine room is at the forward end of the vessel and abaft this are the offal and fish holds.  A shaft tunnel is carried under the fish hold, and ballast and fresh water tanks are fitted at the tunnel sides.  The fish holds are lined with fibreglass insulation, which is sheathed with heavy aluminium plating, and all fish posts, boards and divisions are of aluminium.
In the engine room,  the main propusion unit has been provided by W.H. Allen Sons & Co. Ltd., of Bedford, and comprises an 8 cylinder pressure charged marine diesel engine with a bore of 325 mm and a stroke of 370 mm clutch coupled through a Lohmann & Stolterfoht marine reduction gear to a Liaaen controllable pitch propeller.  On this gearbox, two layshafts are fitted to drive the winch generator and a 44 kilowatt D.C. auxiliary generator.  Auxiliaries comprise a 5 cylinder Ruston & Hornsby diesel engine, coupled to a 40 kw. generator and a Hamworthy compressor of 18 1/2 cubic feet per minute capacity.  A small diesel driven Hamworthy air compressor is also provided.  The main pumps in the engine room are of Hamworthy make and the smaller pumps are by Mono.
On measured mile trials a speed of 13 knots was achieved.

Sold 1989 to Natal Ocean Trawlers Ltd, Cape Town, South Africa and renamed OCEAN WAVE, employed catching shrimp.

Aberdeen Herald, 22nd August 1868;
'TRIAL TRIP - The Ho-So-Maru, a new steam gunboat, built for the Japanese Government by Messrs. Hall & Co. made a trial trip in the bay on Thursday, leaving the harbour about noon, and returning again about four o'clock.  The anticipations which existed regarding her speed were fully realized.  For the first half hour after leaving the harbour she made eight knots an hour before the wind, and during the second half hour, nine knots.  When the vessel was put about, she steamed with bare poles over seven and a half knots, in the face of a stiff breeze, although the engines were not working anything like their full power.  The hopes maintained regarding her speed were thus fully met.  Nothing could have exceeded the manner in which the Ho-So-Maru conducted herself, both under canvas and steam.'"

On 22 November 1905, HOGARTH ran down the sailing drifter POMEGRANATE off Lowestoft, seven lives lost.

On 25 October 1913, HOGARTH collided with the sailing ship MIRROR, which sank with four lives lost.

On 7 June 1918, HOGARTH was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine UB 107 off the Longstone Light, Farne Islands whilst on passage from London to Aberdeen with a general cargo.  One survivor was picked up after nearly two days on a raft but 26 men, including the Master D. Stephen, were lost.

Transcript of letter:

'Dear Mrs Cooper
I think it well to send you the following particulars now received by our London agent from Gunner Bunting regarding the disaster to the ""Hogarth"".
""I have seen Bunting, and he says Flamboro' Head was passed 7.20pm on 7th inst. and they would be just north of the Tyne, and what he reckoned about 30 miles south of the Farnes, when the vessel was struck by a torpedo on the starboard side - amidships, evidently striking the boilers, which in his opinion exploded at the same time as the torpedo.
Everything seemed to be smashed, and all was over in 4 minutes; practically no time for anyone below to save themselves.  It was a very quiet still night with a smooth calm sea and not dark.
His story is that the ""Watch"" had just changed at midnight Friday 7th.  He was in his cabin under the bridge, whilst his mater Robertson had gone aft to the gun position.  He had just got his boots off when all at once he was shot out of his cabin - he thought upwards - and into the water, when he managed to clutch hold of what he ultimately found to be the raft placed on Boat Deck, but was then almost immediately sucked under through the sinking of the vessel, and on coming to the surface and recovering himself found everything vanished - at some distance he heard the cries of two men.  He called out to them to ""Keep a good heart"" and for half an hour or so he heard them, and then all was still.  On daylight coming in he saw nothing but wreckage floating about but none of the boats, only portions of these.  About an hour after he saw a Patrol boat going north but too far off to hear his cries, and saw nothing more until towards evening when an Aeroplane flew overhead and at some distance saw sweepers working.  At the time of the torpedoing it was low water and the flood carried him south, the ebb carried him north to the Farnes, the following flood took him more towards the land, and the succeeding ebb carried him inside the Farnes and into the Forth when he was seen and picked up by an escort of a convoy - ""Othello"" 8:30am Sunday 9th and taken to North Shields.  His right leg was injured below the knee, and the lower portion of leg of his trousers torn off.
His right hand was also injured and a severe bruise on his left shoulder, but these injuries are getting on satisfactorily.""
Yours very truly,
Edward ?

Melbourne Argus, 21/12/1872:
Evidence before Board of Enquiry at Fremantle - HOKITIKA left Newcastle, N.S.W., 7 October with cargo of coals for Mauritius. 2 November about 3pm she came on a patch of dark smooth water off Cape Leuwin, in 2 minutes she struck twice of edge of a rock. Captain Finlay experienced and steady caregul navigator, has been 10 times round the Leuwin and often closer in shore. Ship got clear and all hands immediately set to work pumps, but in about 20 minutes water had increased to 5½ or 6 ft. Yards were then squared and vessel's head turned shoreward in hope of reaching her. 25 minutes later 10ft. water in hold and matters now appeared hopeless. Capt. Finlay ordered all hands into the boats, remaining himself at the helm and keeping the vessel before the wind.  In less than 10 minutes more the water was up to the main rail, rolling right over the bulwarks, and 2 mins. after Captain had left ship she settled down at distance of abut 5 miles from shore. Captain Finlay and the crew got to the town of Bussel on 5 November and from thence got to Fremantle, where they were given passage to Adelaide by Capt. Wilkinson of S.S. PARANA. HOKITIKA was almost a new vessel and but partially insured. Capt. Finlay lost considerably by the wreck, all his private effects and some £30 in cash. Crew also lost everything except what they stood up in. The reception given the shipwrecked seamen at Fremantle was not very cordial or enthusiastic, no one seeming to care for their destitute condition, court decided no blame could be attached to master or mate or any of crew for loss of HOKITIKA.

From letter written 17/01/1851 by wife of Captain Bates of NONANTUM whose coal cargo caught fire in South Atlantic, leading to her being beached and burnt out at Port Stanley, Falkland Islands; 
""There was in port a Scotch ship from Dundee, bound for Valparaiso, called the ""HUMAYOON""; Captain McHenry and he said would take us to Valparaiso.  We left the Falklands 25th Nov. in his ship which was loaded with coal, but which had been in so long time that we thought there was no danger from it.  We had been at sea 12 days and were just round Cape Horn, when we discovered the ship to be on fire, and it increased so rapidly that in 3 or 4 hours she was in flames.  We were at this time 70 miles from land and immediately made preparations to take to the boats; preferring to take our chance of gaining land, although it was an inhospitable coast inhabited only by savages: Just at this moment a sail hove in sight.  We hoisted a signal of distress and she bore down on us (an English ship the ""SYMMETRY"", loaded with coal and bound for Acapulco).  Captain Thompson, her Commander, took us all on board, and in a short time we saw the fine ship ""HUMAYOON"" burn to the water's edge"".

In Lloyd's 1914 reg. it is now owned by the Governor General of the province of Mozam and renamed JOAO COUTINHO of Lourenco Marques, Portugal. The ship appears to be owned in the early 1920's by Captain Doporto and named POLANA, in the same port as before. The ship is traced up to 1986 Lloyd's register. No further info after that date.

Brisbane Courier, 23/12/1874:
A splendid specimen of an Aberdeen clipper ship, the INVERCAULD, has been successfully launched from the building yard of Messrs John Humphrey & Co., into the upper dock... largest ever built at the west end building yards...therefore some anxiety was felt by the bystanders for safety of the colossal vessel as she glided down the ways... which was safely reached without a single hitch. When fairly clear of the building sheds and a float, her fine symmetrical form was fully exposed to view and much admired by all observers. She has a finely-modelled figurehead, representing a stalwart highlander clad in Farquharson tartan. Built under Lloyd's special survey to class 12 years, has iron masts, keelson and hold beams and 2 decks which, with great height between them, makes her very eligible ship for emigrants. Has been built to order of Richard Connon and Co. and is intended for the Adelaide trade. Will be under command of Capt. Robert Philipps, long connected with that trade and will take her place in the elder line of Aberdeen clippers as sister ship to MONALTRIE, CARNAQUHEEN, CRAIGENDARROCH and BUNDALEER.

Wagga Wagga Advertiser, 28/01/1889:
Report of wreck 10/05/1864 - Death of Captain Dalgarno, once master of ill fated ship Barque, INVERCAULD, will recall to many Australians loss of ship on Auckland Isles, south of New Zealand. Barque, INVERCAULD left Aberdeen in 1863 bound for Melbourne. She reached the port in safety and started on her homeward voyage round the horn. Months passed and nothing was heard of her. She was posted missing and her fate along with that of her 25 hands remained a mystery till late in 1864. A French ship cruising to the South of New Zealand touched at the desolate Auckland group and there found sustaining a precarious existence, Captain Dalgardno, his mate Andrew Smith and an ordinary seaman, sole survivors of the gallant crew of 25. They had lived a Robinson Crusoe like existence on those frigid rocks. Captain Dalgarno returned to Scotland by way of America and was speedily in command of another fine vessel.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 11/10/1889:
Funeral of Captain Dalgarno, well known in shipping circles in the City, took place yesterday from his residence in Schoolhill to St. Peter's Cemetery... Captain Dalgarno was one of the three survivors on the occasion of the wreck of the ship INVERCAULD, of Aberdeen, on the Auckland Islands."

This firm, although famous for building one of the first iron ships ever, is not really known as a mainline ship builder in Aberdeen having a very small output but the yard is recorded as existing in York Place around 1837 in the local Trade Directories.  The business started as Vernon & Co and Bowman joined later, this has been extracted from Trade Directories at Aberdeen Central Library.

Aberdeen Journal, 20/03/1844:
Paragraph from Liverpool Albion re. IRON QUEEN, built by and property of our townsmen Vernon & Co., Engineers and Iron Shipbuilders... ""Lately arrived from New York. She took a valuable cargo of manufactured goods out to Rio de Janeiro, went thence to New York with the cargo of an American vessel condemned on the coast and has just delivered her cargo of cotton and hides without a spot or blemish... interior of her hold has more appearance of a comfortable room than of a ship, the paint being as fresh as when put on and her bottom is quite free from rust or barnacles. Considering the comparatively small cost of these vessels, their light draft and other advantages, they cannot fail to become popular with the commercial world.  IRON QUEEN came here [Liverpool] from New York in 19 days, having lost 2 days while lying to, extinguishing fire caused by spontaneous combustion in the cotton of which, however, only 2 bags were destroyed. With a wooden ship the consequences might have been very disastrous.

Glasgow Herald, 17/12/1849:
Brig WILLIAM PRATT, at Chartleston [S. Carolina], reports that on 5 November fell in with barque IRON QUEEN, of and for London for Honduras laden with mahogany, ashore on the reef near Jupiter Inlet, Coast of Florida, took on board Mr. Robertson, wife and crew, who had been in a destitute condition for 10 days: also brought off sails, chains, rigging, etc. and left mate of barque and two hands to take charge of the wreck.

Liver oil barge (according to Sandy Curle)

ISCO IV was a 45' motor barge used to collect cod liver oil from the fleet of fishing vessels that had landed their catch at the fish market.  ISCO IV was a small vessel with a crew of two men that went round the harbour each day to collect the cod oil.  The crew would hoist empty 40-gallon oil drums up to the aft end of the trawler deck about 20' above their deck by a derrick.  Once they got the drums on board they would pump the oil out of the trawlers oil tank by hand pump.  When they had filled the barrel they would start the hazardous job of lowering the heavy drum down to the ISCO's deck and proceed to the next vessel.  In the days of the busy fishing industry collecting the oil could be very dangerous with trawlers going to the fishing grounds and trawlers tying up at Albert Quay as radio contact was very limited between vessels.  It was also dangerous with overspill from the drums as it made the decks very slippery and the oil had a nasty pungent smell that penetrated your clothes. Once the drums had been filled they were discharged at the company's Albert Quay facilities."

Press and Journal 25/11/1907:
A finely modelled, large steam trawler of the whale-book type for French owners the Scoiete Islande et Marco was launched on Saturday afternoon from the yard of the John Duthie (Torry) Shipbuilding Company, Ltd. The vessel measures 142 feet over all, 23 feet in breadth, and 13 feet and 6 inches in depth. She will have powerful engines, to indicate 550 horse-power, and large steel boiler, supplied by Messrs. James Abernethy and Company, Ferryhill Foundry, and all the latest improvements for fishing at Iceland and in distant seas. An electric light installation will be introduced by Messrs. Claud Hamilton, Ltd., Aberdeen. The vessel, as she left the ways, was gracefully christened the ISLANDE by Miss Alexia Duthie, eldest daughter of the late Mr. John Duthie, who was the senior partner of the John Duthie (Torry) Shipbuilding Company, Ltd.
At a cake and wine banquet after the launch, Mr W. G. Jameson, chairman of the company, presided and among others present were Miss Alexia Duthie, Mrs Mitchell, Old Aberdeen; Mr James Abernethy, Ferryhill Foundry, and Master Abernethy; Mr John Fiddes, managing director; Mr William Swan, draughtsman; Mr John Wilkinson, Mr William Beatoe, Mr Frank Fraser, representing other departments of the firm; Mr John Douglas Fiddes, etc.
The chairman proposed ""Success to the Islande"", and stated that this was the first boat the firm had built for a new French firm, although they had done a good deal of work for other French owners. He hoped the vessel would be successful in prosecuting the fishing at Iceland, for which she was specially built, and would be specially fitted, and also the fishing off the cost of Morocco.
The toast was heartily pledged, but as the representatives of the owners will not be in Aberdeen till about a fortnight hence there was no one to reply.
Mr John Fiddes proposed ""The young lady who so gracefully christened the vessel"" and expressed pleasure at seeing one so closely related to one who had been at the head of the firm performing that duty. Mr Fiddes presented Miss Duthie with a gold chain, set with pearls and rubies and having an enamel pendant with miniature portraits attached as a souvenir of the occasion. He wished Miss Duthie many happy days to wear that souvenir.
Mr John Douglas Fiddes acknowledged the gift on behalf on Miss Duthie. He hoped Miss Duthie would have many more opportunities of launching vessels from that yard.
Mr John Wilkinson proposed ""The Ladies"" and Mr William Swan replied, and the toast of ""Bon Accord"" having been pledged, the proceedings terminated."

This ship applied for a ""Mediterranean Pass"" which was given.

Description of the ""Mediterranean Pass"":
Source ""Mediterranean Pass for Rising Sun 1819-1824"", Thomas Balch Library, Leesburg

""For many years prior to the time of this document, pirates based in Tunis, Tripoli, Algiers, and Morocco on the northern coast of Africa, known as the Barbary Coast, had preyed on ships in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean. European nations made payments to these countries to ensure the safety of their merchant vessels.

While the American Colonies were under British rule, they were protected by payments of the mother country and the power of the British navy. However, after the American Revolution officially ended in 1783, ships of the newly independent United States had to manage on their own. For years the Presidents and Congress debated the practice of paying tributes for safe passage for vessels, although they continued to make the payments. Twice the United States sent ships to the Mediterranean to fight the pirates, in 1801 and 1815. Following the second “war” the tribute payments ended.

In 1796 a new Federal law required the government to begin issuing Passports to ships owned by United States citizens to verify the nationality of the ship. The document, called a Mediterranean Pass, was based on the British passport. The top of the document was cut in a scalloped design and sent to the United States consuls in the Barbary states as a method of verifying the authenticity of the pass. The top half of the form contained two engravings. Signatures of the President of the United States and the Secretary of State were in the lower right hand portion, and the seal of the United States in the lower left section. The pass was good for multiple voyages, but had to be surrendered if the ship was sold.

As the United States’ power grew and shipping became safer, the Mediterranean Pass came to be regarded as less important by shipmasters. The $10.00 fee for obtaining the document was discontinued in 1831. By 1860, the Mediterranean Pass was no longer in use.

'Collier Launched at Aberdeen'
'A self-trimming collier for the Electricity Authority (managers Stephenson Clarke Ltd.) was launched yesterday afternoon from the yard of Messrs Hall, Russell & Co. Ltd., Aberdeen.
The vessel is the first of three which are being built by Hall, Russell and Co. Ltd., for the Authority.
As the vessel left the ways she was named James Rowan by Mrs Stella Rowan, a relative of the late Mr James Rowan, after whom the vessel was named.
Lord Citrine, chairman of the British Electricity Authority, and Lady Citrine were among those who attended the launching ceremony.
A single screw vessel of 340ft in overall length, the James Rowan has a raked stem and cruiser-type stern.  She is of about 3700 tons deadweight.
There are four separate holds.  Steam operated deck machinery includes the windlass, a warping winch for operating the steel hatch covers.
All accommodation is of a high standard, the whole of the crew of twenty-six being berthed in single berth cabins.
The vessel's machinery is situated aft.  It consists of a direct acting triple expansion steam engine of North Eastern Reheat design.  The boilers are oil-fired.'

JAMES ROWAN made its last journey to Shoreham on 28 October 1983 before sailing next day to scrapyard after an unsuccessful attempt to keep it as a floating exhibit as the last coal burning ship to be built in Britain.

1984: To breakers at Queenborough, Kent, arrived 6 June.

W.T.S.

Additional details from Sumihiro Sano:
 
Jho-Sho-Maru was transferred to Higo clan and formally named Ryujyo [Prancing Dragon].  The Higo clan then presented the Ryujyo to the Emperor. Ryujyo went into commission on 8th May 1870, as a major warship of the Imperial Japanese Navy. 

When Ryujyo commissioned she was the strongest war ship in the Imperial Japanese Navy, so she was often assigned as the Imperial Ship.

Emperor Meiji sometimes embarked on Ryujyo and she took part in every domestic and foreign incident in the 1870s.  From 1881 Ryujyo took part in training cruises for cadets three times and sailed to Australia, Chile, Peru, Hawaii, and South East Asia.
In September 1888 her engine was removed, and she was assigned as a training ship of the gunnery training school.

2nd December 1893 she was decommissioned, but continuously assigned as non manned training ship of gunnery training school. 

12th Sep.1894 she was commissioned again and moored at the harbour entrance of Yokosuka, as a floating battery with 127 crew (for Sino Japanese War).

17th Feb 1895 decommissioned again.

September 1906 gunnery training on Ryujyo finished because of a new gunnery training facility established onshore.

22nd April 1908 Marquess Hosokawa, the former Lord of Higo clan, submitted a request to the Minister of Navy to dispose Ryujyo's name board for the eternal memory of Higo clan.

31st July 1908 government issued instruction that the bow decoration and name board should be detached before disposal by sale for preservation. 

1908 Ryujyo was sold and then scrapped. 

Ryujyo's bow decoration is preserved at Kumamoto castle/Museum.  Kumamoto castle was the Higo clan's headquarter.

---------------------

WHAT’S IN A NAME? The three BEN ARDNAs.
Does anyone know if there is a hill called Ben Ardna?

The first BEN ARDNA was a steam trawler, launched by Hall, Russell & Co. Ltd. at Aberdeen on the 9th December 1912. She was built at a cost of £5,950 for one of Aberdeen’s leading trawlowning firms, Richard Irvin and Sons Ltd. of Albert Quay, and was registered in Aberdeen with the number A 517 on Boxing Day 1912.
She did not have a long career in fishing, as in August 1914, along with another twenty-seven of Richard Irvin’s fleet, she was requisitioned by the Admiralty and put to work as a minesweeper with the Dover Patrol.
As with her fishing career, her naval career was also short lived. On the 8th August 1915, off the Elbow Buoy at the mouth of the River Tay, she suffered the fate of many other trawlers engaged in minesweeping, and detonated a mine which had been laid by the German submarine UC.1.
She sank with the loss of two of her Royal Naval Reserve crew: -
William Harwood Brown, a Second Hand aged 35, the son of Mrs Mary Duck of Scarborough.
and 
Henry Herbert Morris, a Deckhand and husband of Mrs Helen Taylor of Aberdeen.

The second and third BEN ARDNAs were both wartime “Strath” class trawlers. 
These standard trawlers were built in large numbers during WWI throughout the U.K. and by various shipyards, but all were based on a standard design for both the hull and machinery produced by Hall, Russell, who took the lead in their production.  At the end of the war, the Admiralty had no use for these large numbers of basic minesweepers and in the early 1920s they were sold off for commercial use as either trawlers or small cargo vessels.

In 1920, Richard Irvin bought two of these vessels to replace the company’s war losses, the WILLIAM BARLOW and the JOHN BRADFORD. These were exact sister ships, built by Hall, Russell and launched on the same day, the 15th July 1917, as Yard Nos 606 and 607. 
The Strath Class were all named after members of the crew of either H.M.S. Victory or Royal Sovereign at the Battle of Trafalgar, and both William Barlow and John Bradford were Privates in the Marines on H.M.S. Victory.

The William Barlow was first registered by the Admiralty at London, with the Official Number 144416, but when she was bought by Richard Irvin, they registered her in Aberdeen under the ownership of R. Irvin & Sons Ltd, North Shields. The Lloyds Register Supplement entry (78525) for 1920 lists her as being named the DORILEEN, ex BEN ARDNA, ex WILLIAM BARLOW. This vessel remained in the Irvin fleet until she was broken up in 1957.

The John Bradford was also registered by the Admiralty at London, with the Official Number 144415, and bought by Richard Irvin. Her entry in the Lloyds Register Supplement for 1920 (77709) records her being named BEN ARDNA, ex DORILEEN, ex JOHN BRADFORD. She to was registered at Aberdeen, with the fishing number A412 and remained in Irvin’s fleet until requisitioned as an examination vessel in WWII. She sank in 1942 after a collision on the Tyne, fortunately without loss of life.

Thus, both vessels were, according to Lloyds, named BEN ARDNA, but they changed names. Why, in the case of the DORILEEN, Irvin departed from their usual practice of naming all their ships with the prefix BEN, or who, what or where the name Dorileen came from, is not recorded and remains a mystery.

Aberdeen Journal, 22/05/1861:
Report of trial at Wellington [N.Z.] 5 March of part of crew of JOHN BUNYAN, of Aberdeen. JOHN BUNYAN, Capt. Joseph Allan, sailed from London 10 Nov. 1860 for Wellington direct with cargo and passengers. Close to the forecastle where the crew slept a quantity of bottled beer, part of the cargo, was stowed.  On 19 Jan, vessel being on high seas, it was found bulkhead had been broken and beer extracted. Captain called crew up, but no information was given between this date and 18 Feb. General conduct of part of the crew was careless and negligent on 18 Feb. Greatest part of crew seemed to be in state of intoxification, to have disobeyed orders of officers and engaged in violence. Daniel McDonald, one of the ringleaders resisted being put in irons. Captain said he stepped between his officers and McDonald, presented his pistol and warned ""the first one that shows resistance I shall fire"". Captain reported McDonald struck him a blow on the arm, pistol fired and McDonald was killed.  After great exertions the other ringleaders were put in irons, they being more or less intoxicated.
At trial 8 seamen pled guilty to larceny aboard ship and were imprisoned for 6 months. John McGarrity and Richard Cole were found guilty of making revolt and larceny aboard ship and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. Evidence given by Capt. Allan, Chief Mate Thomas Barnett, 2nd Mate Alex. Davidson, 3rd mate Edward Callan and Carpenter John Elder. A bill for manslaughter had been brought in against Capt. Allan, but jury ignored it. Judge paid tribute to promptitude and determination of Captain and his officers.

Gippsland Times, 11/01/1865:

They were picked up by the whaler Henry Tabor, off Triaidada and were put aboard John Bunyan next day (with their boat).  Boat's crew were in a very exhausted condition.  Mr Harris and the boat's crew wished to thank Capt. Allen, his officers and crew for their kindness.'

In 1866, there was a fire on board and the vessel was scuttled in Sirius Cove, Sydney.  The captain John Duthie Phillips assisted in the salvage and was still in command of the vessel at the time of his death on 14 January 1868.  Cargo insured for £24,423.

Sydney Morning Herald, 14 January 1868:
'The clipper ship, JOHN DUTHIE, belonging to the Aberdeen Line, arrived yesterday morning from London, the passage having been made in 88 days.  
Owing to the death of Capt. Phillips, she has arrived in charge of Mr J. Sinclair, Chief Officer, who has carried out his responsible task to the satisfaction of the passengers.
Respecting the passage he states that the vessel left her pilot on the 16th October off Plymouth, and crossed the Equator on 13th November...
We have to record the death of Captain Phillips, late commander of this fine ship, which took place on the 8th inst. after a protracted illness.  
Capt. Phillips may be said to have spent his life in the Australian trade.  He was chief officer of the British Merchant when she was burned in this harbour.  He was afterwards master of the CAIRNGORM, YOUNG AUSTRALIA, WILLIAM DUTHIE and JOHN DUTHIE.  
When the latter vessel was scuttled in Sirius Cove, about a year ago, he remained on board during the operations for raising the ship, wearing wet clothing for several days, and caught a severe cold, which is supposed to have occasioned his death.  
As a shipmaster, Capt. Phillips bore a high reputation as an experienced and careful navigator, and his invariable kindness to passengers created for him a large circle of friends in this colony by whom he was much esteemed.  
On the news of Capt. Phillip's death becoming known the flags of the shipping, and on many establishments connected with the maritime interest, were hoisted at half mast.  
The funeral is to take place at a quarter to three this afternoon.'

The following anecdote is from the Boyd Cable Correspondence:
'On one occasion the 'PORT JACKSON' and 'BRILLIANT' were due to set sail from Sydney at the same time and the respective masters decided to make a race of it and had a £20 bet between them.  The old wooden ship 'JOHN DUTHIE' was also lying in port repainting and was due to sail a fortnight later.
When 'PORT JACKSON' arrived in the Thames her master asked the pilot if the 'BRILLIANT' were home, and to his utter amazement was told, ""No, but the JOHN DUTHIE has been lying up the river for the last fortnight"".  Her master, Captain Levi, had had favourable winds all the way home and had made the old ship's record voyage.' 

In 1886, the JOHN DUTHIE was sold to John Rust & Son and renamed LUMBERMAN'S LADDIE.  It was meant for the Aberdeen-Baltic timber trade but was lost off the Norfolk coast on 16th December 1888."

Ship 'JOHN TAYLOR' left Gravesend July 10 with 140 passengers and anchored Canterbury 18 October.  Strong contrary winds were experienced until reachng Cape Finiesterre, causing much sea sickness.  The Cape was passed on 12 September.  On 20 September they had a hurricane from W.S.W., the force of the wind sending the ship's forecastle under in 2 or 3 plunges.  The ship behaved nobly, from that time till sighting New Zealand they had strong gales.  On arrival at Canterbury Capt. Cawkitt was presented with an address and money to buy piece of plate by the passengers and healths of Capt. and Mrs Cawkitt were proposed.  4 deaths occurred on passage among the children.

Australian News for Home Readers, 23/06/1866:
London Missionary Society's ship JOHN WILLIAMS arrived Hobson's Bay 19 May and was object of great interest (about 5000 visited on Queen's birthday holiday). She has been built expressly for conveying missionaries to the various stations in South Sea islands. Poop extends as far as the mainmast and after cabin is a beautiful apartment beneath it, with state rooms on each side, amply furnished with all comforts and conveniences which the missionaries may require either in course of their long voyage from Europe or in shorter voyages they sometimes make with native teachers from island to island. Five missionaries aboard on this occasion. After brief visit to Geeleong [Victoria] she proceeded to Hobart Town [Tasmania] and Sydney previous to her departure for the Polynesian Islands.

Daily News, 22/12/1866:
When the JOHN WILLIAMS was beating up to the harbour at Aneityum (New Hebrides) she ran upon a reef and speedily began to let in water.  The natives on the island, especially those belonging to the Christian church there, at once came off to render what aid they could - several came aboard to work the pumps, deeming it a pleasure to render any aid to the gospel ship.  The schooner DAYSPRING was also able to render assistance and in due course the JOHN WILLIAMS was able to get off the reef.  The DAYSPRING accompanied her to Sydney, where she is now on the slip and will soon be as sound as ever and able to continue her glorious work.

South Australian Advertiser, 28/06/1867:
Barque JOHN WILLIAMS sailed from Sydney 16 Nov. 1866 for South Sea Islands. 22 Nov. arrived Amietenam?, took in part of cargo and missionaries, sailed 29 Nov. for Loyalty Islands. Anchored at Vea 1st Dec. 4 Dec. sailed towards Lifa, 6 Dec. anchored Wide Bay. Unloaded Missionary's goods on various islands. 13 Dec. sailed towards Savage Island in fine weather at first, but from 19 Dec. very unsetttled weather. 3 Jan. 1867 made Savage Island. Lay off reef, landed and loaded missionaries and goods. On evening of 9 Jan. ship was getting near the reef and we sent up rockets. One man, using a deep sea lead could find no bottom. 10.30 called the gig alongside and had ladies and children put in her. Shortly after called the other two boats alongside (which had been trying to tow ship off) and got crew into them. She was almost in the breakers when we left the ship. Soon after she struck reef with tremendous crash. We were 72 souls in the 3 boats. We pulled boats towards landing place and reached it about 3 in the morning. Capt. Williams and part of crew have now arrived Sydney from Tahiti (including R. Turpy Chief Officer, G. Geddes 2nd Officer, J. Bobem Carpenter, A. Bell Cook and two apprentices).

Daily News, 14/08/1867:
On 9th January, Capt. Williams reports, the JOHN WILLIAMS was off Savage Island (Samoa) 4 or 5 miles from the shore and the wind was getting  light and then fell off altogether.  As the ship was getting near the reef the boats were sent ahead to tow.  At 10.30 at night the ladies and children and then the other passengers and crew were got into the boats.  She was almost in the breakers when the boats quitted her and struck at 11 o'clock with a tremendous crash.  The boats with 72 souls got to the shore and their passengers were taken through the surf, 2 or 3 at a time, in a canoe by the natives.  The next morning the ship was seen lying on the reef with her back broken and the sea breaking right over her.

History of the London Missionary Society: Famous among those early missionaries was John Williams; when marooned on the island of Rarotonga he built in 15 weeks a 60 feet long and 18 feet wide vessel, The Messenger of Peace, with local materials and native help. A whole line of missionary ships was later named after John Williams and supported by children who collected ""ship half-pennies"" (half-pennies which had a sailing ship on one side). [CWM website]"

Aberdeen Journal, 30/04/1831:
Paddle steamer JUNO, built for Danish owners to trade between Copenhagen, Aalberg and Aarhus, made trial trip from Aberdeen to Peterhead against strong head wind and heavily rolling sea and afterwards stood as far south as Bervie - passengers generally of opinion she was as steady in the water as any steamer they had sailed on.

Engines, combining strength and elegance, are on oscillating principle and of nominal power 180 H.P. Boilers are of tubular kind, calculated to economise fuel. Diameter of paddle wheels is 19' and estimated speed 12 knots. Accommodation for passengers including sofas, capable of making up 80 beds. Ladies and gentlemen's cabins display simple elegance. Neighbourhood of paddle boxes on deck fitted up, according to usual arrangements, with apartments for officers with neatness and taste. Juno does very great credit to her builders, engineers and all concerned. She is commanded by Capt. Raabauge, who during his time in Aberdeen has made many friends by his gentlemanly conduct.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 16/12/1895:
Shipbuilding in Aberdeen, 1895 - last vessel which left Hall Russell's yard in 1895 was magnificent steamer KING SING for Tientsin [China] trade. Launched 16 Nov., has been fitted with Howden's system of forced draught; electric light throughout vessel.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 30/12/1895:
Trial trip of KING SING - in consequence of high southerly wind, heavy sea and dark atmosphere, which prevented marks of measured mile being seen from vessel, she had to put back to port without speed being tested. In the course of the short run compasses were adjusted, engines were found to work admirably and altogether the steamer behaved herself admirably in the heavy sea. Commanded by Mr. J.M. Hay, late of Union Line. Chief Officer is Mr. L.A. Muir and Chief Engineer Mr. Jon Mackintosh. Also on board Mr A.W. Baird, Lord Kelvin's assistant, who adjusted compasses made by James Whyte & Co., Glasgow, after patented design of Lord Kelvin. Steamer left Aberdeen yesterday afternoon for Blyth, where the measured mile will be run.

Monday, 11 September 1893, Page 4:

THE KOSCIUSCO – LOSS OF AN APPRENTICE.
 The Sydney-owned barque Kosciusko arrived yesterday from Gothenburg. She reports a sad accident during the voyage. One of the apprentices, Albert Bear, a son of Mr. Superintendent Bear, of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, when in the act of loosening the main topgallant sail fell into the sea and was drowned. He was never seen after passing the ship's quarter either from the deck or aloft, but sunk at once. The ship at the time was running before a fresh gale and a heavy sea. The main topsail halyards were let go and the foresail let fly at once and the ship rounded to at some risk, but no one caught sight of him ; indeed, had he been seen, it is doubtful if a boat could have lived to reach him. He must have fallen 140ft. The accident caused quite a gloom amongst the crew, the young follow being liked by everyone on board for his manly qualities. "" There was not a soul of us,"" said one of the ship's company, yesterday, ""who wouldn't have jumped overboard to pick him up, blow or no blow, had we caught sight of the lad."" He was a bright, good lad, and the makings of a real sailor."" The report of his loss on the vessel's arrival here caused extreme regret, and came as an awful shock to his relatives. The barque sailed from Gothenburg on the 11th May, and took departure from the Lizard on the 27th. Had strong head winds across the North Sea and down Channel. Got the N.E. trades in lat. 30' W. From Lat. 9' to 4' and 19' W. had strong S.W. monsoon, and crossed the equator in 20' W. Thence to 15' S. had strong southerly winds, having to tack ship several times to keep off the Brazilian coast. and the remainder of the voyage to Cape Otway experienced fresh to very hard gales. Used oil bags when running in the heaviest of the gales with good results. Saw ice three different times between 38' and 41 S. and 20' and 72' E. Also passed a derelict, with part of a mast standing, in lat. 28' N. and 24' W. Spoke the barque Columbia, bound to Valparaiso, in 4' N. The Kosciusko is to Mr. Alexander Burns.

Wrecked off Johnshaven on 21 April 1889 while on  passage from Sunderland to Aberdeen with a cargo of coal.  All of the crew were saved.

Dundee Courier, 17/4/1883:
Board of Trade inquiry in Aberdeen into accident to boilers of steamer LADY CATHCART on 13 March, which compelled vessel to return to port in tow. Court found that chief engineer, W.M. Findlay, was grossly at fault in neglecting to keep boilers properly supplied with water - certificate suspended for 3 months.

Glasgow Herald, 8/1/1886:
Board of Trade enquiry in Aberdeen RE collision off Bell Rock of HAYLE and LEADER. Steamer LADY CATHCART followed in wake of the HAYLE and stood by her after collision. Master and mate of LADY CATHCART gave evidence they did not see the HAYLE steaming round and round and were not asked by master of HAYLE to look out for lives of wreckage after HAYLE ran down LEADER. Enquiry determined HAYLE was undermanned and this contributed to loss of life.

Glasgow Herald, 22/4/1889:
Shortly after 2am yesterday in vicinity of Johnshaven, crew of LADY CATHCART, on voyage Firth of Forth to Aberdeen with coal, were startled by severe shock caused by steamer running among the rocks. Crew escaped by boats as she appeared to be lying in dangerous position. It appears William Gray, 2nd mate, was in charge when she struck, he stated accident was due to an error of judgement, his impression being that vessel was abreast of Bervie and further off land than was the case. No soon as land became visible he gave order for her to be put a point further out. But no sooner had he spoke than she struck on an outlying ledge of rock at Johnshaven. The steamer only held together for a short time after striking.

Captain Penny of the LADY FRANKLIN was Aberdeen's most enterprising whale skipper - almost single handed he helped the city's whaling industry survive until the 1860s. 

In 1850-1851 he led an unsuccessful expedition to discover the fate of Sir John Franklin who had led an expedition to discover the North West Passage.  A silver snuff box (see associated object) was presented to Captain Penny by the crew as a mark of respect 20th October 1857.

Aberdeen Journal, 30/08/1854:
Arrived Aberdeen from the Arctic regions brig ""LADY FRANKLIN"", a bumper ship, bringing about 180 tons of whale oil in a boiled state and 10-12 tons bone, the produce of 27 whales.  This is the result... of a novel expedition commanded by Capt. Penny, the intrepid Arctic navigator. The work was carried out, not in the normal way of returning the same season, but by over-wintering and returning only when full. Leaving Aberdeen 13 Aug. 1853, voyage out was made in 19 days to land and 8 from Cape Farewell, destination being Hogarth Sound on West land of Davies Straits. 12 whales were taken before winter, during which thermometer was fully 40 degrees below zero. Work contiued all winter, boiling operations on ""SOPHIA"", with the party living on ""LADY FRANKLIN"", both vessels being iced in. The ""LADY FRANKLIN"", both vessels bring iced in.  The ""LADY FRANKLIN's"" cargo being completed, Capt. P. left with her on 29 July.

Aberdeen Journal, 17/09/1856:
Brig ""LADY FRANKLIN"", Capt. Penny, arrived here from Hogarth Sound, where Captain P. and his crew have been prosecuting the fishing during the winter, with upwards of 100 tons of boiled oil and 6 tons whale bone, produce of 11 fish.

Morning Chronicle, 04/07/1857:
Remarkable coincidence that as the ""FOX"", fitted out by LADY FRANKLIN to search for remains of Sir John Franklin and his crew got under way from Aberdeen, the ""LADY FRANKLIN"" brig, purchased for the Arctic search under Capt. Penny several years ago, should just have left under Capt. P to pursue the whale fishery during the autumn and, wintering in Cumberland Straits, resume fishing in spring.

Caledonian Mercury, 22/11/1859:
Brig ""LADY FRANKLIN"", belonging to Aberdeen Arctic Co., commanded by well-known Capt. Penny, arrived Aberdeen from Cumberland Sound, having left Aberdeen only at end of June last and Shetland 12 July. He has cargo of 3 whales, about 60 tons oil and a few tons of bone, which will yield a fair return.

Daily News, 08/10/1867:
Captain and crew of brig ""LADY FRANKLIN"", 199 tons, were landed Dover 5p.m. yesterday. This ill-fated vessel was run into and sunk by steamship ""DANZIG"" of Leith at 1.30a.m. Captain and crew had only just time to scramble on board the steamer and were unable to save their clothes or any of their other property.

LADY ROSEMARY was an anchor handling supply vessel originally ordered by P&O Offshore but was bought over during construction by Tide Water Marine and name changed from LADY SYLVIA to LADY ROSEMARY prior to launch day.

LADY ROSEMARY was the forerunner to TROJAN & SPARTAN TIDE. She was a twin screw with controllable pitch props house in kort nozzles. There was a gantry that ran on rails on the working deck to lift the rig anchors clear of the ships stern when lifting it came of another ship belonging to the owners but was never a success.

Prior to the launch day the owners became Tide Wtarer Marine who own the largest fleet of oil supply ships. Tide Water Marine renamed the vessel ROSEMARY TIDE in 1977. The ship was then sold in 1980 to Dalmeijer's Metalen B.V. (Panama) and renamed RANGE TIDE.

'The Lambeth was launched from Hall, Russell and Company Limited's shipyard on 23rd January by Mrs C. Stott, wife of the deputy chief engineer to the South Eastern  Gas Board.

'The Ewell and the Lambeth are raised quarter-deck, self-trimmers with three cargo holds forward of the motor room.  There is a deep tank between Nos 1 and 2 holds.

The masts are telescopic for operation under bridges.  The vessels have a deadweight of 2,835 tons, a length (b.p.) 261'-6"", breadth 39'-4"", depth moulded 18'-6"" and a draft loaded 17'-1"".  Water ballast is carried in the double bottom, the fore and after peaks and in the deeop tank, sufficient ballast being carried to allow navigation without cargo beneath the many low bridges on the Thames.  An oil fuel cross bunker is situated at the forward end of the propelling machinery space.  The ship's company have separate cabins and the accommodation provides a very high standard of comfort.  The captain, deck and engineer officers are housed amidships and the crew aft.

Report into loss by the Ministry of Transport (1947) found that 'the total loss of the LASS O'DOUNE was caused by reason of her putting to sea with unlocated leaks in her hull, with her pumping arrangements in defective condition and with insuffcient crew.'
The inquiry court recommended that the Ministry of Transport should make provision that 'no British sea-going trawler or drifter should be permitted to proceed to sea unless there has been issued in respect of law and within a specified time, a certificate of seaworthiness made by a responsible and duly qualified authority after proper examination of hull, machinery, boilers and life-saving appliances."

LEEDS CASTLE was one of two offshore patrol ships built to police the oil rigs of the coast of Britain with sister ship DUMBARTON CASTLE. They were designed as a prototype for a new design of frigate to replace the navy's leander class frigate. They were twin screw propelled and able to land a helicopter on the aft deck, with a turret mounted gun forward. After being used to patrol the oil rigs they were deployed to patrol the Falkland Island after the Falklands War in 1982 with change over trips of three months duty. This role ended in 2008 and were laid up at Portsmouth where they were sold to the Bangladesh Navy in 2010 and underwent a multi million pound upgrade with main engines gearbox shafts overhauled and new deck cranes generators installed at A&P Hepburn on the Tyne. Bangladesh Navy has now classified them as corvettes with the P number being replaced with F36. The two ships set for Bangladesh on 22 November 2010.

Leeds Mercury, 27/10/1868:
At about 7.45 on Friday evening, remarkably fine and clear night with bright moonlight, the full-rigged ship LEICHHARDT, with 26 passengers and general cargo, was run down at entrance to Thames, about 2 miles below The Nore, by the screw steamer NORTH STAR, also outward bound. LEICHHARDT was proceeding with lights according to the rules when some of passengers and crew saw that NORTH STAR was making direct for their ship. Chief Mate and some of crew hailed the steamer, but no notice was taken of their cries.  NORTH STAR came on at full speed and with tremendous force struck the port side, the force of the collision forcing her round and clear. Captain Phillips saw that the LEICHHARDT was filling and in a few minutes must founder. Chief Mate and most of the men had jumped aboard the NORTH STAR, which showed no symptoms of rendering help. With remaining crew Capt. Phillips got pumps working and women and children away in boats to NORTH STAR. Spanish steamer BEATRICE then sent boats which rescued remaining passengers and crew just in time before LEICHHARDT foundered. Capt. Wallace of NORTH STAR claimed his ship was in charge of pilot, that 10 minutes before collision, when he went to his cabin to consults charts, he saw the ship at anchor and then course should have taken NORTH STAR clear to starboard.

Liverpool Mercury, 05/11/1868:

After being picked up by American vessel, they saw a ship off the Lizard and apparently under repair. She looked like LEUCADIA, which they had been moored near in Portland Roads. Marine Dept. sent to Sydney to have enquiry held on LEUCADIA's arrival. It found that at time JANE GRAY was run down LEUCADIA 200-230 miles from the position.

Renamed Grampian Princess

Built by John Lewis for Southburn Fishing, a subsidary of Craig Stores, Aberdeen who operated a fleet of trawlers. Lindenlea was a very successful earning boat for the company, bringing in the top yearly earnings of the whole fleet.

Lindenlea worked for the company until 1975 when the company was taken over by a big fishing organisation called British United Trawlers (BUT). Sold in 1981 to George Craig & Sons, where it became Grampian Princess in 1982 and fished until 1985.

It was converted for standby work where the fishroom was cleared back to its bare steel work and accommodation area built for the event of rescuing survivors from rig evacuation (2 fast rescue boats were carried on deck).

Sailed with sister ship Ben Strome (Grampian Dawn) to Thames Shipyard, Kent in 1991.  Both ships bought in 2002 and towed to Ipswich with proposal of turning one vessel into a diving ship and the other into a transmitting station for Radio Caroline, to be called Music Man 279, however the cost of conversion proved too high and the plan was abandoned.  The vessels are believed to be still moored at Ipswich pending sale.

The Board of Trade inquiry, before the local Marine Board of Aberdeen, found that the loss of the vessel was due to the default of the Master, in attempting to take the vessel into harbour at an improper time.  Having shown lack of energy, judgement and seamanship, the Local Marine Board recommended Heriot should lost his Master's ticket, and be given a mate's certificate, with the proviso that he could apply for a certificate of competency after 12 months.  However the court had not been properly constituted the Board of Trade could not give effect to the recommendation and Heriot's certificate was returned to him."

Aberdeen Journal, 26/01/1876:
Court of Enquiry, into loss of LOCH BULIG on Lambay Island, off Formosa, 15/10/1875. Enquiry held at British Consular Office, Amoy, 25/10/1875. Following judgement delivered - court having deliberately weighed and considered statement made by Mr. Alex MacPherson, Master of LOCH BULIG, as well as of several witnesses, is of opinion LOCH BULIG was lost through no negligence or fault of Capt. MacPherson, but through vessel having been driven close to coast in a heavy gale of wind, it then fell calm, whereby she became at mercy of strong current and heavy swell setting on to Lambay Island. Court of opinion every precaution was taken to prevent loss of ship which a seaman could take and that no blame be attached to anyone on board.

Sydney Morning Herald, 14/06/1929:
Death of Capt. Alexander MacPherson has severed strong link with the days of the clipper ship. He was 90 years of age and 70 years have passed since he first sailed into Sydney Harbour.  A native of Stonehaven, he began his career before the mast in coastal trader commanded by his uncle, was subsequently apprenticed to famous Duthie family of Aberdeen, ship HERO being his first ""big"" ship. In her he sailed to Launceston, Tasmania, where he saw convicts in chains and leg irons building wharves. 1860s twice wrecked on voyages to Archangel. On second occasion after terrible privations crew at last helped by peasantry, after several months reaching Archangel from where they were sent home. As master Capt. MacPherson sailed to S. America for several years. Afterwards became part owner of ZEUS in which he traded to China, but transferred to three masted schooner LOCH BULIG, which was lost in a typhoon. He was exonerated by Marine Board of Enquiry and took command of ship MARTHA in China trade. Retired 1896.

Taken up for minesweeping April 1915. Mined 13 May 1918.

LOCH NAVER was launched by A. Hall & Co. Aberdeen in 1906 and requisitioned in February 1915.  She was mined in the Aegean off Mindisi Point, on 13th May 1918.

Extract from British Warships of the Ironclad Era 1860-1919 by David Hepper:
LOCH NAVER (Admiralty trawler no. 1179) trawler
Hired 1915; 216 tons; 120 1/4ft x 21 1/4 ft; 1 x 6pdr
Skipper Edmund Artis Butler RNR
Former Aberdeen trawler fitted as patrol vessel and based in the Aegean.  She left Syra at 8.50am for Cape Spathi, Zea on 13 May (1918) and was not heard from afterwards. The lighthouse keeper at Port St Nikolo on Zea later reported that at about 2pm he had seen a trawler disappear in a cloud of smoke. A search of the area found wreckage in position 37.50N 24.26E,  between Cape Angelistro and Port St Nikolo, and it was presumed that she had been lost by striking a mine.  All thirteen hands were lost.

The mine that sank LOCH NAVER was laid by the German mine laying submarine UC74.

Stranded on the Skerry Rock off Boddam in a gale 15th December 1942.  Crew rescued by Peterhead lifeboat.

Aberdeen Press & Journal, 16th December 1942:
'Lifeboat Rescue Thrills'
'The crew of a trawler was rescued in the nick of time when their vessel went ashore on the noted Skerry Rock, between Peterhead and Boddam early yesterday morning. 
'The rescue was in large measure a personal triumph for Captain James Winter.  Peterhead's sixty-nine-year-old harbour master, who acting as coxswain of Peterhead lifeboat, took the lifeboat through a gale and heavy seas to the trawler.  
'The trawler was down at the after end and the waves were breaking high over the crew who had gathered at the head.  Despite the rock Captain Winter succeeded in taking the lifeboat alongside.
'Skilful Handling
'The rescue craft was rising twelve feet with every wave, but so skilfully was she handled that that each time a trawlerman was able to jump aboard.  All twelve jumped to safety, but the last man, George McRae (63) landed awkwardly on the lifeboat, and before he could be assisted he was crushed between the two vessels.  He was taken to hospital.
'Shortly after the crew were taken off the trawler caught fire.  Later the boilers exploded and in about three and a half hours after going on the rocks she had sunk.
She had a large catch of fish.'

Aberdeen Press & Journal, 23rd January 1943:
Captain James Winter received the RNLI Bronze Medal for his part in the rescue.  ""It was a very fine piece of work,"" said an official of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  ""They are a grand lot of fellows these lifeboat-men at Peterhead,"" he added, ""Captain Winter's actions was typical of their attitude towards life-saving.'

On 6 June 1944 HMS LOCHY was involved in the anti-submarine screening of the task force for operation Neptune, the Allied landing in Normandy.
From 16 until 29 March 1945 LOCHY docked in the Selborne dry dock at Simonstown, South Africa.

---------------------------------------

'HMS Lochy was to be my home, and that of the 140 crew for several months to come.  Her duties were to escort convoys, and hunt U-boats and, as such, she was most successful.  

So on the great day we were towed across Aberdeen Harbour to oil up, already having taken on board provisions and ammunition and, when the engines were started up, the ship became alive and independent.  
Initially we left harbour to run the 'measured mile' just north of the River Don, and then we were off to Tobermory, Mull.  

The Lochy was going north about through the Pentland Firth.  There we hit a ferocious gale.  It was a shake down voyage in more than one sense, because anything not lashed securely would soon crash down.  With an open bridge, our captain, Lt Commander Roberts RNR decided to stay on the bridge throughout all the time it took to reach our haven.  A well-trained ship was worth more than three ill trained, and we were to have sixteen days of intense skill learning and become most proficient.  Nobody was to be exempt and our teacher was none less than the fearsome Vice Admiral Stephenson RN through whose organisation ultimately many hundreds of ships were to pass.  

Having reached our haven in Tobermory Bay 'hands to breakfast' was piped, the first chance most had had an opportunity to eat anything.  But somebody was ringing the ship's bell furiously, and nobody knew what it meant.  The Vice Admiral had got aboard without anybody being aware, and was ringing it.  He wanted to know why the captain and officers had not met him at the gangway.  Furthermore he ordered all the ship's company to fall in on the quarterdeck, and gave us such a dressing down, nobody could forget it.  

During our stay all were trained, gunnery, Asdics, Communications, Radar etc.  

When we left we were off to war: the Atlantic, Mediterranean, South Africa and ultimately near and Far East.  She was to be the first ship up the Rangoon river in Burma.  We were at D-day, and as part of the famous EG2 (Captain Walker) HMS Lochy was part of that skilled hunter-killer group.  She was present at the sinking of U-333 (Cremer's famous U-boat) and took part in the saving of USS Donnell, which had been hit by a GNAT (German Navy Acoustic Torpedo) in the Atlantic and was towed safely to Troon in 1944.'

Report of wreck, Aberdeen Courant, carried by Sheffield Independent, 29/08/1829:
Leaving Aberdeen for Sunderland in Ballast, with strong north easterly wind + swell, she fell so much to leenard that anchor had to be lowered. Before it could halt the vessel she struck rocks at Short-Ness + immediately filled with water. Sea broke in tremendous force over fore part of the vessel + crew sheltered in after part on quarter deck, a lead line was brought to shore by the faithful ship's dog, after which a strong line was linked from ship to beach. Crew hesitated to use this until Captain Scott, master pilot, demonstrated how to use it by throwing hymself from a pinnacle of the craggy rock. Thus crew of 5 brought to land. Vessel, which had been kept together by being jammed in a cove, went to pieces during the night.

Hobart Mercury (Tasmania), 25th August 1874:
'To the Editor from 'A Tasmanian Shellback' - Re. para concerning ship Lufra, I think your reporter rather exaggerated her merits.  We are all aware that she is a remarkably fine ship, but it is going too far to say she is the finest and handsomest vessel in the world or which has entered our waters.  We all know that Tasmania is rarely visited by ships of any note, but still I think there are some lying at our wharves which might compete for looks and good qualities even with the Lufra.'

Glasgow Herald, 8th August 1874:
'Ship Lufra has on previous voyages discharged har cargo satisfactorily, but on present occassion much merchandise damaged irreparably by rats, there was great anxiety during voyage when vessel was found to be making water.  On discharging cargo it was found that the mainmast was saturated and rats had eaten through the upper scupper, when this was submerged a torrent of water was poured into the hold.  Had she experienced tempestuous weather it would have been impossible to keep the ship afloat.'

Morning Post (London), 23rd July 1889:
'During violent gale on Sunday two ship wrecked crews were landed at Deal by a lugger from barque Lufra, Capt. Rogers, of Hobart, and barque Erageroe (Norwegian).  Crew of Lufra state their ship left London docks Wednesday with general cargo for Tasmania when off Isle of Wight in severe weather they fell in with the Norwegian barque.  During the gale the two ships collided. The Norwegian vessel was struck in stern and binnacle light exploded, setting fire to her.  Lufra had large quantity of gunpowder amongst her cargo and as she was close to the burning ship Lufra's captain ordered crew to take to the boats and they pulled to a safe distance.  After Norwegian vessel sank Capt. Rogers and 12 of his crew pulled back to the Lufra, but other boats were unable to reach her because of the gale.  After three hours men in one of Lufra's boats (and the Norwegian crew) were picked up by another Norwegian vessel, however, Lufra's remaining boat with three men, drifted off into the darkness.  They had oars but no rowlocks.  It is hoped that they will be able to keep afloat till another vessel falls in with them.  Men from Lufra's rescued boat report water was 
breaking over it and they were up to their waists in water.'

Extract from 'The Tea Clippers Their History & Development' 1833-75, pages 216-217 (illustration on p216):
""She was the last composite built sailing ship to be constructed by A. Hall & Sons, bearing their yard number 265. She was built for Anderson & Co. Banff. She began life as a full-rigged ship with a single topsail on the mizen. She made 2 voyages to China and then 3 out to Adelaide. In 1874 she was bought by Alexander McGregor & Co., Hobart and was reduced to a barque. She was placed in the Hobart to London trade for the next 23 years and proved to be a fast vessel. Her average time on the passage to London was 89 days and for the passage to Hobart the average was 90 days. In 1876 she had a close race out to Tasmania with the ""Wagoola"": both vessels sailing from London, left England on the same tide - 20 July - and reached Hobart on the same tide on 25 October - 97 days out.
The ""Lufra"" was sold to L. Castellano of Naples in 1897 for £1,250 and was renamed ""LETIZIA"". She was broken up in 1905"".

(London) Standard, 26/10/1850:
Brig, LUNA, Archangel to London, with cargo of linseed and general merchandise, having struck upon Newcome Sands, her commander Capt. David Patey, arranged with the Harbour & Railway Co. for their steamer LOWESTOFT to tow the vessel to port for £50. However, before she reached LUNA, a large party of the Lowestoft beachmen had resolved to secure the salvage for themselves. They wrote letter to Harbour Master saying they had reached wreck first and stating salvage was their only means of livelihood. About 120 of them proceeded in their boats to the wreck, when they began furious onslaught on crew of the steamer, seriously injuring the master. Steamer returned to port to cheers of lower class of townspeople, who supported the beachmen. Then coastguard men, well armed, went off in steam tug to the wreck, which they safely conveyed into harbour without molestation from the boatmen.

Aberdeen Journal, 19/11/1856:
Smuggling at Montrose - Master and Steward of brig LUNA, of Aberdeen, were tried for smuggling brandy - Steward found guilty and fined.

[Report of ice in White Sea from Captain of barque Albania]. Vessels gathered there all canted in different directions and smashing commenced, with masts and yards breaking, etc. But brig LUNA, Capt. Patey, being carried in between two grounded icebergs 15 ft. higher than her decks, she appeared to lie as snug as if in a tidal harbour.

Dundee Courier, 06/05/1870:
Serious accident befell James Winter (14), apprentice seaman on brig LUNA, lying at Blaikie's Quay, Aberdeen. He was sitting on plank, end of which projected over bulwarks and was struck with great force by passing wagon. He fell 13ft into hold. Quite insensible with serious injuries to head, he was carried to his residence in Cotton St.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 18/03/1882:
Fire, observed Sunday morning on Aberdeen brig LUNA, laden with lime, was same night successfully extinguished. Every aperture was covered with sand, which effectually smothered fire. Discovered fire had been, not in hold, as believed, but in forecastle, possibly caused by careless loss of candle."

Watson Commander, lying in the East India Docks. This high-classed vessel, built at Aberdeen by Messrs. Hall, is well known in the Melbourne trade for her rapid passages and sound delivery of cargo. She has first rate accommodation for passengers in her commodious poop and will carry an experienced surgeon if necessary [repeated till 11 Sept. - ""immediate despatch""].

Hobart Mercury, 18/12/1867:
The large clipper ship MACDUFF, one of the finest and fastest merchantmen trading to this port, was telegraphed at the heads yesterday morning from London.  The MACDUFF... has made some good passages in her time... altogether eclipsed by her present performance... 66 days from Plymouth, a feat seldom equalled and rarely excelled even in the palmiest days of the crack clipper ships which were to be met with in Hobson's Bay during the decade from 1853 to 1863.  Captain Watson, who still commands this fine vessel, has in addition to making a rapid passage been successful in anticipating the arrival of the English' mail.

The ship was running at 11 or 12 knots under plain sail.  Boatswain estimated it would have taken 3/4 hr. to shorten sail, by which time the man must have dropped 8 or 9 miles astern.  The lifeboat could have lived in the sea, but it was upside down on the skids and would have taken half an hour to lower.  The Captain looked over the stern when the mate reported the loss and said it was impossible to save the man, so the ship stood her course.  The witness admitted they were drunk on the voyage.  The Board heard that there was no foundation for the charge - Chairman said in cases of this kind the Master had to choose between losing the life of the man who fell overboard or the lives of those who went in search of him.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 16/11/1880:
Melbourne, Oct. 2 - MACDUFF, ship, from London, lying at Williamstown, parted her stern mooring lines during a gale Sept. 21 and came into collision with the MERMERUS, ship, occupying the next berth at the pier, carrying away part of her poop rail and losing her own flying jib boom guy.

Melbourne Argus, 14/08/1882:
10 seamen appeared charged with disobeying the lawful commands of the Master, Capt. Watson.  The Captain insisted on their turning out every morning at 4 o'clock to wash the decks.  They had refused duty for 2 days, after which Captain promised to overlook the offence, if they conducted themselved properly during remainder of voyage (which Officers acknowledged they had done).  Men were sentenced to 6 hours imprisonment, except one who declinded to go back to the ship (7 days imprisonment).  The men complain of being half starved and badly treated by the Captain during the voyage.

Yarmouth, 5 April - brig MAGNET, Robb, from Aberdeen to London with granite. Arrived here yesterday with bowsprit cathead, one anchor and mainyard carried away, sails split, vesel badly chafed and leaking, having been in contact with a large ship.

Aberdeen Journal, 27/11/1872:
As brig MAGNET, of Aberdeen coal laden, was coming into the harbour with sails set, she caught the ground on the platform inside the North Pier.  She had gone too far to leeward and, as heavy sea was running, struck and got her rudder unshipped. Tug BRITANNIA got a rope attached and after 1/4 hour got MAGNET afloat. Second tug came to her assistance and by aid of a number of people on shore she was got into the lower basin. As she was quite full of water she sank opposite Ferry Boat Inn as soon as tug rope was slackened and nothing was to be seen but her masts. After being lightened of part of her cargo, she has been beached beside shipbuilding yard of A. Hall & Co.  She is very considerably damaged. MAGNET was commanded by Capt. Joss, is property of Mr. Robert Maitlandand is, we understand, not insured."

Flower Class corvette built by Hall Russell Limited in 1940 for coastal defence and convoy escort duties.  

After the Second World War she was transferred to the Air Ministry, renamed 'Weather Observer', and fitted out as a floating meteorological observatory in 1947. She was one of four such ships operated by the Air Ministry in the North Atlantic. Every six hours the crew would launch hydrogen balloons to record the temperature, humidity and pressure at 50,000 feet in order to help forecast the unpredictable British weather. The ship was scrapped at Ghent, Belgium, on 8 September 1961. 
[details from National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.  NB - NMM also have a model of Marguerite as a weather ship in their collections]

Five Flower Class corvettes were built by Hall Russell's; CORIANDER, MARGUERITE, MIGNONETTE, MARIGOLD and LOOSESTRIFE.  Of these, only MARIGOLD did not survive the war as she was sunk by Italian aircraft off Algiers in 1942.

27 July 1941: KELLWYN Sunk  taking part in convoy OG-69 carrying cargo of coke, route Tyne, Oban, Lisbon.  Crew 23 men: 14 killed, 9 rescued.

Details of sinking:
Between 00.21 and 00.24 hours on 27 Jul, 1941, U-79 (commander Wolfgang Kaufmann) fired a spread of four torpedoes and the stern torpedo at the convoy OG-69 about 350 miles west-northwest of Cape Finisterre and had to dive because a destroyer was closing in, so Kaufmann only saw a column of fire and heard several detonations. He reported three ships sunk and two others probably damaged. In fact, only the KELLWYN (Master Alexander McLean) was hit and sunk, the later explosions must have been depth charges from the escorts. The master, ten crew members and three gunners were lost. Nine crew members were picked up by the British armed trawler HMS ST. NECTAN (LtCdr H.B. Phillips, RNR) and landed at Gibraltar on 1 August.

---------------
MARIE LLEWELLYN: The Spanish Civil War:

On 17 July 1936 Francisco Franco led a coup against the Republican Government. The Spanish Civil War had begun.  MARIE LLEWELLYN was a 1400 ton steamer built by John Lewis & Sons. Launched in 1920 the cargo ship was owned by a Cardiff shipping company, she was captained by David ""Potato"" Jones (he was called Potato to differentiate him from two other Jones also running the blockade: ""Ham-and-Egg"" and ""Corn-Cob"" all names derived from the cargoes their vessels carried). Although he was advised not to sail for Bilbao by Commander Caslon of HMS BLANCHE flamboyant Potato Jones decided that the adventure and the profits to be made outweighed the risks so he sailed from the French port Saint-Jean-de-Luz.  MARIE LLEWELLYN might well have been soundly built in the Aberdeen tradition but modern she was not.  Unlike the trawlers the merchant steamer carried no radio meaning that if she had been intercepted by Nationalists there was little chance of the Royal Navy coming to her assistance.  Nevertheless with 1000 tons of potatoes she made for Bilbao, looking to carry back to Wales much needed iron ore for the country's steel industry.  It was not to be and after much bluster, with the ship's whereabouts being uncertain (Aberdeen Press & Journal headline was ""Where is 'Potato' Jones?"") MARIE LLEWELLYN was reported as making for Alicante.  The bold captain was praised as a hero but this was not universal.  Member of Parliament Robert Bernays described him as a ""grand figure"" but rather than a hero Jones was a ""sailor of fortune"" who should not be given the protection of the Royal Navy.

Potato Jones's MARIE LLEWELLYN which had caused such a stir in 1937, was renamed KELLWYN and eventually became part of the British war effort against Germany. On the 27th of July she was torpedoed by U-79 with the loss of 19 men. The struggle against Franco's brand of fascism had grown into a worldwide conflagration.

16 November 1941 she engaged U-433 which sank at 2155hrs, after a sustained attack with depth charges and gunfire in the Mediterranean, 25 nmi (46 km) east of Gibraltar. MARIGOLD picked up a number of survivors and took them to Gibraltar.

15th June 1942 she picked up 41 survivors from the British merchant SS ETRIB, 20 survivors from the Norwegian tanker SS SLEMDAL and 29 survivors from the British merchant SS THURSO that had been torpedoed and sunk by U-552 380 miles (610 km) West of Corunna, Spain.

13th November 1942 she rescued 81 survivors from the British merchant SS MARON which had been torpedoed and sunk by U-81 off Oran, Algeria.

The Times November 21st 1941
'U-Boat Sunk. The Admiralty is now able to announce that a German U-boat has been destroyed by the corvette H.M.S. Marigold (Lieutenant J. Renwick, R.N.R.) in the area in which H.M.S. Ark Royal had been torpedoed only two days before. As this U-boat was patrolling in the same waters it is practically certain that it was concerned in the attack on H.M.S. Ark Royal. H.M.S. Marigold attacked with depth charges. These forced the U-boat to the surface and it was at once engaged by gun- fire from the corvette. The crew of the U-boat took to the water as their vessel sank. Thirty-four survivors were picked up and are prisoners of war. H.M.S. Marigold was built by Hall, Russell and Co., of Aberdeen. U-BOAT SUNK PROBABLE ATTACKER OF ARK ROYAL.'

Off Brighton 31 May ship MARQUIS OF ARGYLE for Sydney.

Daily News, 18/02/1867:
For Adelaide direct the well-known Aberdeen clipper ship MARQUIS OF ARGYLE, A1 11 years, James Monro Commander, now loading in the London docks. This splendid vessel, built under special survey by Messrs Walter Hood & Co. of Aberdeen, is well known for her great speed and for her high class and sound delivery of cargo. Intending passengers are invited to inspect her very superior cabin accommodation.

Hobart Mercury, 12/09/1867:
Capt. Munro of MARQUIS OF ARGYLE courteously forwarded the following epitome of the voyage - left downs 2 May, crossed the line 5 June, passed Tristan D'Acunha 24 June, Meredian of Cape of Good Hope 7 July and St. Pauls, Indian Ocean, 26 July.  Throughout the passage eastward in the Indian Ocean the weather was very fickle and stormy, with torrents of rain.  Favourable winds were very rare and seldom lasted over 12-16 hours.  From the last day of June to 10 July the weather was unusually fine and warm with light airs of wind and calms.  The ocean as smooth as a millpond in the middle of winter in the vicinity of what has long been called the Cape of Storms.  Thus we lost 11 days. Another week was lost after passing the Isle of St. Pauls by a very severe gale, for the first 3 days it blew a hurricane, the sea frightful, rolling in huge mountain waves, very hard gale for 3 days more.  The ship of course lay to, but behaved admirably receiving no further injury than loss of one boat, breaking glass of skylight and unshipping poop and topgallant forecastle ladders.  The good and substantial Walter Hood & Co., Aberdeen, bulwarks fitted 6 1/2 years ago, withstood the shock.  Passed Cape Barda Light on Sunday evening 11pm, the first land seen since passing Palma (Canary Islands).

The ship MARQUIS OF ARGYLE met with a curious mishap whilst on a voyage from Hong Kong to Melbourne. A violent gale sprang up and the whole of the Chinese passengers narrowly escaped being drowned. A violent gale from north east and high cross sea raged for 24 hours and the deck house in which the Chinese passengers were berthed was swept away by a terrific sea. They had a most narrow escape of their lives, several of them being washed into the rigging. The heavy sea smashed in the bulwarks of the vessel."

It is said accident was caused by pilot on board the Marys causing the steersman to starboard instead of port the helm."

Details from a letter written by William Anderson of Arbroath, who sailed on the maiden voyage of the ship tells that the ship was launched at Aberdeen on Wednesday 24th March 1841. 
William Anderson worked as ships carpenter, for which he was paid £4/15/00 (£4.75) per month. He joined the ship a month before its launch. 
The MATHESIS sailed from Aberdeen (about 3 weeks after launch) for Dundee, to ""load up"". The destination of the maiden voyage was to be Port Philip (Melbourne) and Sydney. 
Despite a quick passage (18 days) to the Cape de Ver (Cape Verde) islands, the ship did not reach Sydney until 30th January 1842. This was because of a fire on board on 9th August 1841, which caused them to put into Rio de Janiero for repairs. The fire was caused by the third mate, ""a spark from a lanthorn (lantern) falling with some straw"". They arrived at Rio on August 25th. William left the ship, with four other men, on its arrival Sydney at the end of January 1842. This had not been his original intention and was apparently the result of serious discontent among the crew. (details of letter courtesy of R. Henderson).

The Maitland and Hunter River General Advertiser, Wednesday 29th April 1846: 
""CRUEL PUNISHMENT AT SEA.
[From the Britannia, Nov. 29.]
Alexander Gordon, the master, and John Cummings, the chief mate, of the ship Mathesis, from Brazil, now lying in the London Dock, were charged, at the Thames Police Court, on Wednesday, with assaulting William Scott, an apprentice belonging to the same vessel, on the high seas, within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty of England.
William Scott, a youth aged sixteen years, stated that on the outward voyage, the day after crossing the line, he was rather late in turning out of his berth, and the mate came down with the end of the fore bowline (a thick rope) and flogged him with it as hard as he was able.  He was then driven on deck, and sent up aloft, with nothing on but his shirt, to tar the rigging down. The mate followed him up, and while he was upon the foreyard again beat him with the rope. After he had received three or four lashes he ran further out on the yard-arm to save himself from the blows, and was followed by the mate, who continued striking at him. He then jumped off the yard-arm and made an attempt to catch the backstay, which he missed, and fell into the sea. The ship was going at the rate of seven knots an hour, but she was put about, and he was picked up in an almost in-sensible state. He had scarcely recovered his breath before the mate recommenced flogging him with the same rope. The captain then dragged him to the after part of the ship, and exhibited a heavy cat, and said that was made for him, and gave him a lash with it. The mate sent him up aloft with the tar-bucket again directly he had put on a dry shirt, and he accidentally dropped some of the tar on the top-gallant-sail in consequence of the rolling of the ship. He was asked by a boy to go to the wheel, and as he was about to do so, the mate seized him and made him fast to the mizen rigging, and after he had let down his clothes and hauled his shirt over his head, the captain gave him two dozen lashes with the cat on his bare back. After he was released, and while his back was bleeding profusely, the captain ordered him to go on his bended knees and implore his mercy. When he had done so, the mate seized him up to the mizen rigging a second time, and said he should give him another dozen. The captain, however, would not allow him to do so, but called one of the boys, who was ordered to give him a dozen lashes, and they were inflicted in the presence of the captain and mate. He was not ill-used any more that night, but on the following night the master said he intended to put some vitriol on his back, and called upon the mate to pour it over him, saying that he was afraid of burning his fingers. The mate said he was also afraid of burning his fingers, and ordered him to go down on his hands and knees. When he had done so he was stripped, and the mate poured a quantity of vitriol out of a phial over his back. The pain was excruciating, and he sang out for mercy. That night it was his watch on deck, and the mate compelled him to walk about on the poop with a handspike over each shoulder, and also made him count the number of tails of the cat, and how many knots there were. The cat had eight tails and was very heavy. His back was sore and inflamed for some time, and he could not bear anything to touch it.
The boy's evidence was corroborated by several witnesses, and the prisoners were ordered to find bail, each in their own recognizance of £200, and two good and sufficient sureties of £100 each, to appear and take their trials at the present sessions of the Central Criminal Court. The prisoners were removed in the custody of the gaoler"".

The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser, Saturday 5 February 1842:
""Water Police Court.
MARINE POLICE COURT, 4th FEB. 1842.    
Alexander Gordon, master of the barque Mathesis, was charged on information at this Court yesterday, before Captain Browne, with having assaulted Mr. Van Nyvel, a cabin passenger by his ship, on the 30th January last; the said ship being then on the high seas on a voyage from Rio to Sydney.
Mr. Purefoy, who appeared on behalf of Mr. Nyvel stated, that his client was a foreigner, and a stranger to him; but, from his evidence, together with that of other witnesses, he (Mr. Purefoy) would be able to show, he hoped to the satisfaction of the Bench, that Mr. Van Nyvel, his client, had been treated in a most unjustifiable and outrageous manner by Capt, Gordon, without any provocation having been given for such conduct on his part. His client had been formerly living at Rio de Janeiro, and the Mathesis, from Dundee for Sydney, having put in there for supplies he met Alexander Gordon, her captain, with whom he made an agreement to come on to Sydney as a cabin passenger, but shortly after the Mathesis left Rio some disputes took place between the Capt. and his Emigrants, which he attributed to the interference of Mr. Van Nyvel, and on the 3rd of January, the Captain turned him out of the cabin after using the most abusive language to him. Mr. Van Nyvel was then obliged to go and live among the Emigrants till the vessel arrived in Sydney. The Bench would easily perceive what a hardship' his client, who had all along been moving in respectable society, would consider his being turned from the cabin to put up with the indifferent comforts of a steerage. There were no class of persons to whom greater powers were delegated to than the masters of ships. In fact, the comforts and happiness of the emigrants during the voyage, depended in a great measure upon the character of the captain. When such power was placed in his hands, it was but right and proper that if he abused that power, he should be made accountable for it in a Court of Justice ; and he would be able to prove that his client was turned out of the cabin without having given any provocation for such conduct on the part of the captain. When he afterwards wished to walk on the poop, he was violently pushed off by the captain, without any sufficient reason being assigned. When a person abused his power in this manner it was but right that he should be made amenable to the laws of the country for such gross behaviour as had been used in the present instance.  
Henry Van Nyvel, the complainant being sworn, deposed - I met the defendant, Alexander Gordon in Rio; I knew him to be the master of the Mathesis; I engaged a cabin passage from him to come on to Sydney; I paid him the passage money, which amounted to 114 milreas, or £15 sterling. I went first on board the Mathesis, as a cabin passenger on the 15th November. There was no other cabin passenger, except the doctor ; I continued in the cabin till the 5th of January, on which day the captain said to me, ""I read in your eyes that you have been telling the emigrants something about a particular subject;"" he then ordered me to leave the cabin, or he would have me lashed to the mast and flogged. In consequence of these expressions I left the cabin and went to live among the emigrants. On Sunday, the 30th January, about ten in the forenoon, I went on the poop, when Captain Gordon said, ""off my poop."" I replied I had taken a cabin passage, and would remain; the captain then ordered the first and second mates to take me off, but they refused ; he then came up himself, and seized me by the collar of my coat, and dragged me to the steps of the poop, and pushed me off; he also said he would place me in irons; I went again on the poop, and he used me in a similar manner; I then called the surgeon and mates to witness the assault; the captain replied "" if that is all you want, you will soon get it"", telling me I was a lunatic. After this I continued on the poop during the day ; we were then off Sydney Heads about 4 miles.
Cross-examined by Captain Gordon. - When I met Captain Gordon, at Rio, I asked him for the situation of steward; I stated I would be glad to sleep ahywhere on board, but that was previous to my uncle advancing me money to pay my passage; I remember having a conversation with Gordon, in a coffee house, in Rio, when I stated I had no more money to give him, but would give him a spy glass I had in my possession to allow me to come in the cabin ; I delivered the spy glass to the third mate ; when I came on board, the Captain being ashore at the time, I was treated as a cabin passenger till the 3rd of January; in every respect; I never made an agreement with Capt. Gordon to come as a steerage passenger.
Thomas Robertson, surgeon of the Mathesis, deposed, I know Captain Gordon, he is a native of Aberdeen, in Scotland, Mr. Van Nyvel joined the Mathesis at Rio, as a cabin passenger ; he came on board as such, and slept and dieted in the cabin the same as I did ; the captain said that he understood Mr. Van Nyvel had been carrying tales from the cabin to the emigrants, and ordered him to Ieave the cabin,  which he did; I do not recollect the day on which this conversation occurred, but I have it  written in my log book ; the Captain said if he did not leave the cabin he would lash him to the rigging and give him a good drubbing ; do not think the Captain had sufficient reason for turning Mr. Van Nyvel out of the cabin, if it was only for thinking he told tales to the emigrants, for I never heard he did so ; it was I that told the emigrants about the tales he referred to. The complainant conducted himself as a gentleman during the time I knew him, when he was both in the cabin and steerage;  I recollect Mr. Van Nyvel coming on the poop, on the 30th of January, and being ordered off by the Captain ; the former refused to go, when the latter ordered his first mate to take him off, which he refused. The Captain then seized Mr. V. Nyvel by the throat, and pushed him off the poop. I remember when the Captain came on board in Rio; he said he had a cabin passenger coming on with him to Sydney, and ordered one of the state-rooms to be cleared for his reception ; we had no other cabin passenger; except Van Nyvel.
Mr. Robert Anderson, first officer of the Mathesis, was then called, and stated that he refused to turn Mr. Van Nyvel off the poop, although ordered by the Captain, because he did not think himself justified in interfering in the matter, unless they came to blows.
Captain Brown was of opinion that sufficient evidence had been brought forward against the defendant to justify him to send the case to a jury. Captain Gordon was then committed to take his trial, but allowed bail, himself in the sum of £50 and two sureties for £25 each"".

Aberdeen Journal, 28/08/1844:
While the barque MATHESIS of Aberdeen, Gordon Master, from Ichaboe, was taking the River Tay, she went ashore on the elbow-end bank.  After remaining for a number of hours in a somewhat perilous situation she was, with considerable difficulty, floated off, after throwing overboard upwards of 50 tons of guano.  Vessel was afterwards towed up to Ferry-Port-on-Craig, where she is discharging her cargo.  It is understood she has received considerable damage.

Freeman's Journal, 29/11/1845:
""Atrocious cruelty to a sailor boy"" - at the Thames Police Office, London, Alexander Gordon, Master and John Cummins, Mate, were charged with assaulting an apprentice of the vessel, William Scott, on the high seas during her outward voyage to the Brasils.  Two incidents were quoted - when Scott was late in turning out and when he dropped tar when aloft tarring the rigging.  Detailed evidence of appalling floggings and of vitriol being put on back wounds.  At one point Scott fell overboard from rigging when trying to escape from Mate (and was recovered).  Gordon and Cummins bailed to appear in Central Crimincal Court, London, they claimed the did not strike the boy.

Caledonian Mercury, 19/1/1837: Jersey, 13 January - schooner, Matilda, Minto, from Newcastle to Jersey, was wrecked on the Seven Islands on 23 December. The moment the vessel struck she sunk, just affording time to the captain with his crew consisting of six men and a pilow belonging to Island of Guernsey, to embark in their boat. But in making for the shore, she was struck by a tremendous sea which capsized her over their heads. Melancholy to relate seven out of the eight persons met a watery grave, the only one saved was William Jack who, being a good swimmer, succeeded in reaching the shore."

MAUREEN JUNE was classed by the builders as being a mark one pocket size trawler side fishing, part owned by the skipper Terry Taylor and Don Fishing Co. Terry Taylor was noted to be the youngest skipper at that time to own shares in the boat and he later went on to a bigger boat also called MAUREEN JUNE 10 years later. The name comes from his wife and daughter's first names.

In 1980 MAUREEN JUNE was sold to Don Fishing Co. after Terry got his bigger boat. She was renamed DALEWOOD A372 in 1979, registered with owners (Don Fishing Co. Ltd).  

In 1987 the vessel was renamed THIRLET BF59 for owners William Andrew & Deborah Jayne West of Banff.   This was probably when she was converted from trawling to seine netting where all the trawl gear was removed and seine gear was installed, and rope drums.

In 1990 the vessel was renamed KARVELLA FR252 and owned by George Stephen & Charles Noble and Caley Fisheries (Peterhead), registered in Fraserburgh. 

All traces of fishing gear removed and fishroom emptied out and cabins installed in the fishroom and was then used as training vessel for Maritime Trades training Dundee and called LIVINIA until 1995.

In 1995 she was sold to private buyers as a yacht and up for sale as of 4 February 2008.

As the schooner MERCURY, MacLean, of Aberdeen was proceeding on her voyage from Aberdeen to Konigsberg on 23 March, she was struck by a heavy sea which carried away part of her bulwarks etc. and stave her longboat. It also threw her on her beam end and, her ballast having shifted, she lay in a very perilous situation. The captain was obliged to cut away the mainmast and part of her rigging, when she righted and was driven into Bridlington Bay. Crew all well.

'When ready to be launched the Mercury was placed on two large waggons and hauled with crab winches until close to the quay wall, when she was transferred to 'ways' and launched into the harbour, a part of the quay wall having been taken down for the purpose.  She entered the water with so great velocity that she went right across the dock, ran into the steamer Sovereign, and broke off her own figurehead.'

Case was keenly litigated for 3 hours by agents for each side. The Justice of the Peace decreed Anderson should pay the seaman mitigated penalty of £1.13.4 with £2.13.4 expenses or 6 months imprisonment.

Aberdeen Journal Wednesday 22 June 1853:
'Yesterday there was launched from the building yard of Messrs Hall, a splendid ship-rigged vessel, named the 'Mimosa'.  Her measurement is 447 tons, new measurement and 540 tons old measurement.  The 'Mimosa' is the property of Liverpool owners and is the third vessel which Messrs Hall have built for the same parties.  She is intended for the South American trade and is to be commanded by Mr Kemp, a gentleman of long experience, whose fair partner gave the vessel her name.  The 'Mimosa' is a really splendid ship and promises to be worthy of her builders.  She at present lies at Provost Blaikies Quay.'

This ship became famous for carrying the first contingent of Welsh men, women and children to Patagonia to start a colony in 1865.

Phillips said that if in after years he was spared to settle quietly down in the north east corner of Scotland, every time he looked at the cup and salver would remind him of day of regatta in Jan, 1874.

Mr & Mrs Alexander Harper celebrated their golden wedding. Mr. Harper, who was an orchardist at Golden Grove for 45 years, was born in Parish of Dunnottar, Scotland. He made 2 trips to Australia in the ship MONALTRIE and on second occasion he deserted his ship while she was loading at Port Adelaide in 1874 or 1875.

Maitland Mercury, 15/09/1877:
Adelaide - ship MONALTRIE is aground, but is expected to float off without too much damage.

South Australian Chronicle, 13/10/1877:
Marine Board met 8 Oct. to investigate grounding of MONALTRIE in the port stream 11 Sept. Ship's master said tug ELEANOR towed her to the North Arms. A smaller tug, SOPHIA, took her in tow 11 Sept. and she grounded off Maclaren Wharf. Master said he had no fault to find with pilot Germein. SOPHIA gave her 2 or 3 jerks, but could not get her off. Pilot said wind strengthened as she passed Marden's Point (and other ships passing) and water was so shallow that ship did not answer her helm as quickly as she ought. Had the larger tug ELEANOR been provided by the tug company, ship would have been in port before high water. Board censured pilot for removing ship with a tug of such small power as SOFIA and cautioned him to be more careful in future. Captain reported no injury to ship's bottom.

The ship ""MORAVIAN"", Captain Edward, belonging to Messrs George Thompson Jr. & Co., Leadenhall Street, which has passed Plymouth up Channel for London, left Melbourne January 15, rounded Cape Horn February 17 and crossed the line March 11.

Melbourne Argus, 04/07/1867:
The first ship on the berth for London is the celebrated clipper ship Moravian, Capt. T. B. Ayling, which will sail Saturday next without fail.  Her homeward cargo is all aboard and, as the antecedents of this fine ship are well known, it is not at all surprising that she should take a very large quantity of gold with her.  The Moravian, after her voyage home from this port last year, underwent a thorough overhaul and refit and this, in conjunction with her well known sailing capabilities, will account for the rapidity with which she has been landed on the present voyage.

MOUNT ROYAL was built for Malcolm Smith in 1962/1963? and owned by this company until 1981.  She was then owned by Albert & David Reid of Orkney, registered fishing number now K458, same name.
In 1985-1993 she was owned by Kenny Bain. Some time during this ownership the ship ran aground, date and location unknown; the ship was salvaged and rebuilt and sold to unknown Fraserburgh owners in 1993 and renamed MARGERITA STRACHAN FR112.
In 1994 she was renamed UNITY PD14 for Unity Fishing Co., Peterhead.
The ship was decommissioned in 1996 and sank while in tow of Lossiemouth, 1996.

MOUNT ROYAL was designed as a smaller version of the previously built 100ft trawlers, but retaining the same catching capabilities with lower running costs. This boat was the basic design of what was to be known as the Spinningdale class, produced from 1968 onwards.

MOUNT ROYAL was one of the Mark One pocket class trawlers; the visual difference was that Mark One had single mast and straight wheelhouse, Mark Two had bipod mast and a flared wheelhouse. MOUNT ROYAL was the first of the pocket class trawlers developed by John Lewis, which became popular with many companies and skipper owners, as they could be used for different methods of fishing e.g. seine net and trawling. The pocket class was developed as the distant fishing grounds of Iceland and Faroes imposed a 12 mile limit to foreign boats which made long distance trips hard to make a living over the coming years.  The class was upgraded to Mark 1 - Mark 2 - Mark 3.

MOUNT ROYAL made headline news during the fishermens strike around Britain with many ports closed with fishing boats blocking the harbour entrances to all shipping except ferries to the islands. One day during the strike (Aberdeen) MOUNT ROYAL breached the lines and was blacklisted after the strike was over.

Captain Begg of the MURRAY reports that on night of May 26 in Lat. 23.40S, Long. 37.50W [Mid Atlantic between Brazil and W. Africa] one of hands at masthead saw a ship on fire. In the darkness it was most appalling spectacle. A boat was lowered and the gallant crew wound a water-logged boat with 4 men clinging to it. A rush or passengers had made for the boat and she had filled, leaving only the 4 survivors. At dawn the MURRAY stood towards the vessel, which was one mass of flame and masts gone. The MURRAY's boats and a schooner's boat rescued people who were clinging to floating spars. All but two were picked up, but over 120 were lost by fire and water. The ship was the Italian barque MANNIN BARAABINO, Genoa to River Plate. Fire from galley had ignited the deck and the combustion of the cargo, which was mainly spirits, was very rapid. The MURRAY stood by for two days.

Aberdeen Journal, 1/1/1873:
We learn that the screw steamer NAMOA, built by Hall Russell & Co., Footdee, arrived at Singapore having been only 30 days making passage from the downs.

Hampshire Advertiser, 17/1/1891:
NAMOA left Hong Kong for Swatow at 8am 10th December with 5 saloon and 220 Chinese deck passengers, chiefly returned emigrants from Straits Settlements with their savings. At 1:15pm, same day from among Chinese passengers a band of 40-50 appeared on deck dressed in a uniform not unlike Chinese soldiers and armed with revolvers and cutlasses. They divided themselves into 4 bands and began simultaneous attack on saloon (where Captain and passengers were at lunch), the engineers' and officers' quarters, the bridge and the engine room. Attack so sudden and determined that resistance impossible. Second officer was made prisoner and ordered under threats of instant death to show where treasures and valuables were. 2nd engineer and 2nd officer shot in the arm. Another gang, pointing revolvers through skylight of saloon, told captain they were going to rob passengers. Captain Docock was shot in right breast, staggered to his stateroom and sank dying on his bed. 2nd mate was compelled to go into saloon and tell passengers to come out of their rooms, where they had hidden, and go into the captain's stateroom, where the captain lay dying and all the Europeans were brought together and door nailed up. Before leaving pirates threw a bag containing about 200 dollars into engine room as present to native firemen. They quitted the ship after being in possession for about 8 hours. Ship returned to Hong Kong, where wounded were removed to hospital. Pirates took only personal belongings, cargo was not taken, although it included 40 chests opium."

Glasgow Herald, 03/06/1886:
Judgement of enquiry into stranding of NATAL on Crocodile Rock, held at Bombay.  Court considers Captain Tytler made a mistake through carelessness in laying down his position on his chart.  But taking into consideration that Crocodile Rock was incorrectly marked by one mile on his chart and his great discretion and promptitude at time of accident and bringing his ship safely to Bombay, the court scarcely censures him.

Supposed loss of NATAL - very grave fears are entertained for safety of barque NATAL, owned by Messrs J. T. Rennie & Co., Aberdeen.  NATAL left Calcutta for Natal 16 November and though voyage should have been accomplished in little over 40 days, she has never been heard of since she sailed and it is feared she must have foundered in a typhoon.  Captain Scorgie, a careful navigator, has been Captain of vessel 2 years and was previously Mate of Messrs Rennie's QUATHLAMBA [O.N. 77453].  He was accompanied by his wife, a native of Aberdeen to whom he had just been married.  Carpenter also Aberdonian.

Wrecked in storm 24th February 1844.  Passengers and crew rescued by steam tug SAMSON, captained by Captain Robinson and manned by volunteers, including Capt. Peter Cadenhead and eight other captains.

The following is an extract from
THE RESCUE!  LIFE SAVING at ABERDEEN 1802-1924 by Jake L Duthie:
 
During February 1844 the local Clipper Newcastle could be seen anchored a mile and a half off Girdleness.  Her rigging was gone, only the stump of her main mast remained and she was flying distress flags.  The Newcastle was no 19th Century coffin ship but a stout vessel launched from the Duthie Brothers' shipbuilding yard at Fittie only two years earlier.  Crowds gathered at the North Pier were of the opinion some rescue mission should be mounted.  About noon the lifeboat was launched and manned by a scratch crew under Captain Penny one of Aberdeen's most famous whaling captains.  In spite of their strenuous efforts the life boat crew failed to pull their boat through the breakers at the harbour bar.  They were trying to row straight into the teeth of a hurricane.  Forced to give up the unequal task between human muscle and the raw fury of wind and waves, Captain Penny had his men land the lifeboat on the beach behind the North Pier, only narrowly escaping with their own lives.

Following this failure the crowd became even more anxious that the Newcastle's passengers and crew should be saved before nightfall.  The Lord Provost who was on the spot convened a hasty meeting of the Harbour Commissioners present, the Captain Pilot and a number of seafarers.  After discussion they decided to ask Captain Robinson, owner of the steam tugs if one of them would try to reach the vessel.  At 4 p.m. at almost full tide the tug Samson steamed over the Harbour bar under Captain Robinson's direction.  On board were a total of sixteen men, nine of them captains of ships tied up in the harbour.  The Samson steered down channel, survived the boiling broth of green sea at the harbour mouth and made for the Newcastle.  All the way out the Samson ran the risk of having her slim funnel washed away and her fires doused.

When they reached the Newcastle's leeward side, the Samson's crew lowered a boat which made two trips to transfer the passengers and crew from the stricken vessel to the steam tug.  The Samson rescuers and rescued then rode back safely to Waterloo Quay.  Next day the Newcastle was still afloat and the Samson went out to take her in as salvage. This notion was abandoned and the vessel was left to her fate.  After surviving the tempest for fifty hours the clipper went down by the head in fifty fathoms of water.  She was later washed ashore at Cove.

Adelaide Advertiser, 29/02/1896:
Report on wreck by Mr. Raeder, Mate - after they left Vancouver 10 Jan. were struck 24 Jan. by huge storm. A big sea shifted the deck cargo and broke the pump handle. Capt. Broadfoot had his head injured and several seamen were hurt. The ship began to leak and water gained fast. Ship was rolling heavily and taking waves over both rails. Men had pumped for 3 days and nights, stopping only for meals. Water was 12ft. in hold. They hoisted a signal of distress and were rescued by the compeer. They fired the vessel so it should not be danger to navigation. They arrived 5 Feb. at Oakland [California].

Crew arrived Auckland, NZ, 3 March, Capt. Broadfoot recovering from his injuries.

The NINEVEH, now a sloop, was stranded 1 mile north of the river Don (Aberdeen) whilst carrying coal. The Capt. was Mr. Walker.

Gross Tonnage: 1174 ton",,"Canadian Government, Minister of Transport, St John's",,"Yard Number: 853

Launched April 1956 by Mrs Philip Grichy, of Grand Falls, Newfoundland.  Single screw diesel engine.  Specially designed to operate as passenger and cargo vessel on the Newfoundland Coast.  Strengthened for navigating on ice.
Accommodation for 50 1st class and 40 2nd class passengers and had 33 officers and crew.
Change of owner 1987-88 Trans Maritime Chiriqui S. A., registered Panama.

A sister ship of the BONAVISTA, the NONIA was built for Canadian National Railways in 1956 at the Hall Russell yard in Aberdeen, Scotland. The diesel-powered ship was similar in design to earlier coastal steamers and could accommodate 90 passengers as well as freight. Commanded on its maiden voyage by Captain Joseph Prim, it replaced the Codroy on the run between Lewisporte and Baie Verte. In the summer months the NONIA delivered mail along the Labrador coast. In August 1961 the ship was called upon to assist the community of Musgrave Harbour when it was threatened by forest fire. It transported 760 people from the area to safety on Fogo Island. After 20 years in the coastal service, the ship was taken over by the federal Department of Fisheries. As a patrol boat it helped to enforce fisheries regulations within Canada's 200-mile limit. In 1980 the NONIA passed into private ownership."

We are to observe safe arrival of brig OCEAN, of Aberdeen, at London. This vessel, of about 260 tons register, sailed from Shields to London on her first voyage before the late storm and, after being nearly a month at sea, was heard of on Friday.

ABERDEEN JOURNAL, 10/01/1816:
New brig OCEAN, Hogg, of this place, about 260 tons register, after breaking her moorings, parted from one of her bow anchors, owing to a tier of vessels coming down on her, she went athwort hawse of a ship sunk on the bar, by which accident she was upset. The crew were obliged for their preservation to jump onto the sunk vessel. The OCEAN, after swinging clear, departed to sea with loss of her bowsprit, lower topmast, etc. We are happy to state she was picked up by the VENUS, of Sunderland, and towed into Shields on Tuesday.

Aberdeen Journal, 28/01/1863:
To be sold by Public Roup 2 Feb. at Office of John and Robert Ligertwood, Advocates, 89 Union St., Aberdeen, 6 64th shares of ship ""OCEAN MAIL"" of Aberdeen, built 1860 and presently lying in the London Docks.  Carries well and sails fast , is in good order and well found in stores; was yellow metalled 1862.

Liverpool Mercury, 02/11/1863:
OCEAN MAIL was loaded with a rich cargo of teas and silk to the value of £150,000.  She left Shanghai August 1 for London and on following morning she struck suddenly on a sunken rock, filled rapidly and soon afterwards went to pieces.  The crew were all saved with the exception of the pilot and two apprentices.

Belfast Newsletter, 04/11/1863:
OCEAN MAIL suddenly struck with a fearful crash and heeled over 6 or 7 streaks.  Her head flew round as she sat upon the rock and she fell over several more streaks with a crash as if the whole of her bilge was carried away.  The pumps were at once sounded... all hands were immediately set to them, but to no avail... the ship was working backwards and forwards as on a pivot and it was certain she was rapidly going down, the water being up to the deck.  The crew were ordered to lower the boats and after much difficulty were got away; but unhappily one of the boats upset and the pilot and 2 apprentices perished.  Capt. Linklater was the last to leave.  Both sides of the YANGTSE were lined with portions of her wreck and cargo.  The OCEAN MAIL had chiefly been employed in trading between England and China."

Glasgow Herald, 21/05/1869:
OMAR PASHA left Moreton Bay [Queensland] 1 February with her full complement of passengers, which with crew made 84 souls. She was laden with wool and other colonial produce and all went well until 22 April, when fire broke out in the hold at 4.30am - so rapidly did the flames spread, owing to inflammable nature of cargo, that by 11.00am ship was burning from stem to stern and in 7 hours after she went down.  Some time previously Captain, crew and passengers got into the boats and on the same day were picked up by an Italian barque bound for New York.  They remained on board her until 26th when four vessels were fallen in with, which took them off.  All crew and passengers thus saved. 53 souls including Captain Grey were landed by full rigged ship ZEALANDIA at Cork. They were almost entirely destitute of wearing apparel or money.  The rapidity of the fire barely allowing them to escape with their lives. In Queenstown all necessaries were supplied to them and they left on Tuesday night for England. OMAR PASHA had no specie [gold] aboard.

Subsequent Names: LOUISA (1999)

ORCADIA was an inter island ferry that carried cars, passengers, cattle, sheep and provisions for the people on the islands of Orkney.

The ORCADIA had sliding hatch doors on the port and starboard sides of the ship at the fore end of the ship for loading cars and cattle on to the cargo deck.  A mast with a derrick was situated forward end to load and unload cargos to the lower deck below the cargo deck through a hatch.

January 1962 the Orkney Islands Shipping Company took over from Orkney Steam Navigation Company and ORCADIA (the third vessel of that name) took over the route.  ORCADIA was managed by the Orkney Islands Shipping Co, but owned by the Secretary of State for Scotland.

ORCADIA was chartered to P&O in November 1982 and finally withdrawn from service in 1990.  Sold 1994 and at some point owned by Trans Channel Ltd, Kirkwall.  Renamed LOUISA (1999) registered to Kingstown, St Vincent & the Grenadines Islands, Carribean.  Owners LGFTH Louisa Ltd.  LOUISA returned across the Atlantic in October 2004 to El Puerto where she was used around the coast of Cadiz.  

In early 2006 the Spanish civil guard raided the vessel and found she was operated by an armed gang engaged in plundering archaeological remains from the sea bed. Police found rifles and ammunition together with remains of 17/18th century cannon balls from the battle of Trafalgar. Reported to be laid up under arrest in Spanish Puerto de Santa Maria, Cadiz, Spain, 2009.  Outcome of case, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines v Spain, that no action should be taken.

Although there is no mention of this vessel in Lloyd's Register of these years, the ship was apparently trading to the Baltic Countires under Capt. Robinson. ORLANDO sailed from Aberdeen bound for RIGA on 9 April under Capt. Robinson.  The following account came from another vessel and says that a fleet of seventy sailing ships bound for Riga had rounded the point into the Gulf of Riga on 23 April 1939 and proceeded along a cut in the ice about a quarter of a mile wide.  They had proceeded only 25 miles when the wind changed and the ice closed in on them forcing them to anchor on the night of the 24th. On the morning of the 25th about eight o'clock the people of the ORLANDO of Aberdeen were heaving their clothes on to the ice and in three minutes she went down leaving no trace.  They walked over the ice to the land - a distance of six miles and stayed there two days before proceeding. On reaching Lebau Capt. Robinson, Captain Horn and three other British masters were lodged in one house and the mates in another.

""The East Coast fishing boats take a lot of beating.  They are tough and have to be, and so are the men who sail them.""
This statement was made by Miss Patricia Furness, daughter of Sir Christopher Furness, who yesterday named the motor trawler Ormesby Queen which was launched from the yard of Messrs John Lewis and Sons Ltd., Torry, Aberdeen.
Miss Furness was speaker at a luncheon party in the Douglas Hotel which followed the launch.
She had just been presented with a brooch by Mr J. Lewis as a memento of the occassion.
Mr Andrew H. S. Lewis, who presided, said the vessel which had been launched was up-to-date in every respect.  She was the second of four which his firm was building for Messrs Talisman Trawlers Ltd. Lowestoft.  Mr G. E. Guthe thanked Messrs Lewis on behalf of the owners.
The Ormesby Queen is a flush-deck type of vessel incorporating a well flared bow and cruiser stern. She is 113ft. 6ins. long and has a beam of 22ft.  Accommodation is provided for a crew of twelve.'

ORONTES was the last ship built by Walter Hood & Co.  

Details of a race between ORONTES and the ETHIOPIAN:
'The ETHIOPIAN made her first voyage to Melbourne in sixty-eight days under Capt. William Edward, sailing her last voyage under the British Flag in 1886, being by that time reduced to a barque rig.
On her passage home from Sydney she had a remarkable race with the iron ship ORONTES. The two vessels cast off their tugs together outside Sydney Heads, proceeded to sea and next sighted each other off the Horn, afterwards being becalmed together in the Doldrums, then both spore the same ship (exchanged signals) off the Azores or Western Isles. As they reached the Channel, ORONTES came up under the counter of ETHIOPIAN, which was hove-to taking soundings in fog. Finally ETHIOPIAN made the East India Docks one tide ahead of ORONTES, thus winning the race and a considerable sum in wagers'.

Requisitioned in December 1939 and designated as an armed patrol vessel.  Returned to owners, 1940.

On the night of 11th September 1940, the BEATHWOOD was 1 mile east of Montrose Coastguard lookout, on the east coast of Scotland. As one newspaper report described it, 'she was lying at anchor, completely blacked out, when at about 10 o'clock a German aircraft spotted it by the light of the moon. Most of the crew were below deck.'

Some reports indicated that there were nine crew and two survivors, so there may still be one further crew member, yet to be identified, who also survived the attack.
The only man known to have survived is the Mate, Alexander Gardiner Mair, who lived to the age of 70.
Over 3 weeks after the attack, the body of Alexander Pirie was discovered at Usan, near Montrose, and buried at Hillhead Cemetery, Portknockie. No others were recovered.

Bombed and sunk 11 September 1940.

Fine brig PALLADIUM, Crabb, which sailed from Aberdeen 9 March for Riga, has not yet been heard of. As her boats were found on Jutland coast near Robsnaut about 11 March there is much reason to fear that the vessel, with all on board, met a melancholy fate in the tremendous gale of that day, which proved so destructive to shipping on that dangerous coast, as appeared by the many vessels missing and great quantity of wreck cast ashore.

It is generally accepted that the first ship with pole masts was the iron ship PATRIARCH built in 1869 by Walter Hood & Co. and in the absence of her sail plan the claim is substantiated by photographs.

Newcastle Chronicle [New South Wales], 3rd Sept. 1870:
'Letter from Mr John Coutts, passenger by ship Patriarch from Sydney (sailed 16th April 1870) to London.  ""After 3 days of calm moderately heavy gale drove us within 80 miles of coast of New Zealand.  At height of gale Rev. William Purves died.  His remains were committed to the deep next day with water washing about the decks and tossing making it difficult to keep one's footing.  After 3 weeks of poor daily runs, averaging about 150 miles a day, we fell in with the usual strong winds and in 11 days were at the Horn.  Our brave ship took over very little water in gales, but we took over one heavy sea.  It came over the poop, filled the waist of the ship & washed 2nd officer off the poop onto the main deck.  Water rushed aft, burst in saloon doors & filled captain's cabin.  With ship tearing through the water at speed of 16 mph and sea white all around, one feels the excitement of speed as if on a fast horse.  One day we made a fine run of 333 miles and generally around 280.  18th May we rounded the Horn, but too far off to see land.  On 30th May we passed close to ship Liberator, 40 days out London - Sydney & signalled each other to report us on arrival all well.  We gave them three cheers to which they replied.  17th June we were in Saragosso Sea, midway between Africa and America, 2000 miles from the mouth of the Thames, which we hope to pass in 10 days.'

Sydney Morning Herald, 1st Oct. 1892:
'Patriarch will be floated into Martis Dock today for overhaul & greasing before her voyage to London.  She has now close on 2000 bales wool on board and more waiting in store.  Captain Breach expects early departure for the old country.'

Sydney Morning Herald, 24th July 1894:
'Firm of George Thompson & Co., owners of the White Star Line of clippers of Aberdeen, has always been of good repute both among passengers and seamen.  The rule of the White Star Liners is good food, enough of it and a comfortable forecastle or house on deck. To those who do not like vibration of the screw in steamships and to whom time is of no great object, a trip home in one of these fine liners should be very pleasurable.'

Launceston Examiner, 21st Nov. 1898:
Patriarch, well known Aberdeen White Star Ship, loaded coal at Newcastle for Manila and there loaded hemp for London.  Capt. Mark Breach writes from St Helena that ""luck has been against us.  Passage to Manila was marked by calms and variable winds.  In Solomon group we were 12 days in sight of one island.  At Manila we took in 8580 bales hemp, filling even our spare cabins.  Very bad weather started in the neighbourhood of the cape [of Good Hope] such as one must expect in winter time in these parts.'

Newcastle Morning Herald, 16th January 1904:
'Norwegian barque Patriarch, from Tucket Wedge for Buenos Ayres with timber, which went aground near Rio Grande, has been refloated.'

""In 1869 the Aberdeen White Star Line gave their first order for an iron clipper ship, the result of which was the famous 'PATRIARCH'. George Thompson was only contented with the very best and 'PATRIARCH' was no exception to his rule. Built of the best iron plating at a cost of £24,000, she was considered the finest iron ship in the world when she first came out. She had a poop 90ft long, under which extended a magnificent saloon. In her rigging plan she was a long way in advance of her times. Her top masts and lower masts were in one, and her top gallant masts were telescopic, fitting into the top masts; and in the seventies she was fitted with double top gallant yards on fore and main, whilst she still carried stun sails in the eighties when most ships had discarded them.
As a sea boat she proved herself on numerous occasions. Notably in the Indian cyclone of 1892, which she weathered out with only the loss of a lifeboat, whilst the fine Loch Liner 'LOCH VENNACHAR' was totally dismasted 70 miles away. She possessed that very rare quality in iron vessels - dryness. And during her life of 29 years under the red ensign she never had a serious accident, and never made a bad passage. PATRIARCH'S best 24 hours run was 366 miles, and her best weeks run was 2,060 miles, her main royal being set the whole time.
'PATRIARCH' was no doubt lucky in her captains: Capt. Pile took her from the stocks until 1876, Capt. Plater had her 10 voyages from 1877 to 1887, Capt. Allan from 1887 to 1890, and Capt. Mark Breach took her until she was sold in 1898. PATRIARCH'S maiden voyage was almost as much of a record as THERMOPLYAE'S, each passage being the best ever made by an iron ship at that date. On her outward passage with 40 passengers and a large general cargo, she arrived in Sydney on 10th February, 1870, only 67 days from pilot to pilot, and 74 anchorage to anchorage. And on the homeward run she went from Sydney Heads to the West India Dock in 69 days.
This was an extraordinary performance, as anything under 90 days is very good for an iron ship on the homeward passage. After this the PATRIARCH was one of the most regular ships in the Sydney trade. She was never much over 80 days going out, and though she never repeated her maiden performance coming home her passages were most consistent and she only twice ran into three figures in over 20 passages from Sydney. In 1897-98 the good old ship sailed her last voyage under the red ensign - a round of London, Sydney, Newcastle N.S.W., Manila and home in 13 months, on his arrival Capt. Mark Breach was horrified to find that his beloved ship had been sold to the Norwegians for a paltry £3,150, and on 1st November 1898, he hauled down the celebrated house-flag and handed her over to her new owners. On Christmas Day, 1911, she left Algoa Bay for a gulf port, and on 23rd February, 1912, got ashore on Cape Corrientes, south of the river Plate, and became a total loss.""

At anchor Gibraltar 23 May, schooner PERA, from Liverpool, bound to California with a party of gentlemen aboard. To be hoped they will be more successful in finding the Elderado of the present day than those who preceded them 300 years since [reference to California Gold Rush].

Standard [London], 11/07/1854:
Court of Queen's Bench - Edwards V. Webster Bart. Plaintiff was wholesale grocer and brought actions against Sir Augustus Webster to recover sum of £466 16s. Defendant had been in Royal Navy and he and a Mr. Brabazon and some other gentlemen seemed to have thought the gold diggings at California were likely to yield a greater benefit to them than anything in this country, and so they purchased the PERA, schooner, to proceed to California. They procured an introduction to plaintiff to obtain stores and cargo. Plaintiff supplied goods to value of over £600 and had payment of about £200. Young gentlemen, not having funds to discharge debts, transferred their interest in the vessel to shipbroker named Wooldridge, but eventually sailed for California. Mr Brabazon had not since been heard of but defendant returned and subsequently succeeded to his title and estates: defendant said he had nothing to do with the vessel and had gone out on it as a passenger, but there would be proof he had held himself out to the world as owner of the vessel and must therefore be responsible for the goods supplied to it."

PETER DENNY arrived Otago 1 Sept and discharged all her passengers in good health.  Passage out has been made in 90 days, sailed from the Clyde on 2 June with 154 cabin and steerage passengers; crossed the line 6 July in 200W and subsequently had strong SSE winds as far as 24°S, making it necessary to tack to keep off the Brazilian coast.  In running down her easting she went to the southward of Gough Island and Tristan D'Acunha, experiencing most variable winds, seldom steady more than 12 hours.  On approaching New Zealand she met with NE gales and was driven to within 50 miles of Auckland Islands, only sighting Stewart's Island on Thursday 31 August.  There were 4 births aboard.

PHOENICIAN, barque, London to Sydney N.S.W., spoken 8 August, 52S, 34W [S. of Falkland Islands].

The Argus, Melbourne, 24 June 1852:
""The Aberdeen Clipper-Built Barque Phoenician 
(from the illustrated London News, February 21)
This fine vessel has just made the quickest passage from Sydney on record, bringing with her upwards of 80,000 (?) lbs of Australian gold. The Phoenician left the colony on 12th November and arrived off Plymouth on 3rd instant. Thus makng the passage in 83 days. Sailing and carrying powers were never more happily combined than in this vessel, which has discharged 780 tons of dead weight and has invariably made such passages as have not been surpassed either by British or American Ships. The Sydney Herald of 11th November in reference to the Phoenician says:- ""This vessel will again leave this port tomorrow for London... She will probably arrive in England about the 20th February, thus accomplishing the passage out and home, including detention of loading and discharging, in the sport space of 8 months and a half... An Aberdeen correspondent of The Times expresses the hope that when the facts are duly considered it would no longer be contended that the American clippers have any just claim to be considered the fastest sailors or as worthy of a preference over British ships like the Phoenician and others of the same build"".

On 23/01/04 a Mr Williamson, of Whalsay in Shetland phoned to enquire about Lewis yard number 366 because the builder's plate was in possession.  When the vessel he was connected with was being decommissioned, the plate was found aboard and no-one knew how it got there.  They thought that possibly it had been removed from PISCES one night as a drunken prank.

Pisces was one of the new pocket class trawlers developed by John Lewis. It fished in the North Sea and Shetland waters. It was rigged for fishing over the starboard side only. It worked under the Don Fishing Co., until it was sold in 1983, to a company owned by a Mr. Terry Taylor, a successful skipper on the Maureen June and other boats. Pisces was altered to fish from the stern and a 3/4 long shelter deck was added from the forecastle.

Wrecked Domesnes (Poland), November 1834:

Aberdeen Journal, 26/11/1834:
Sorry to record loss of fine new brig, PLANTER, of this port, Capt. Baxter, on her passage from Riga, laden with flax and lint seed in barrels, bound for Belfast, she sailed from Riga 26 October. After two days heavy gale between Domesnes and Lyscroet experienced tremendous squalls and showers of sleet and hail. On 28 Oct. at midnight wore ship expecting to get round Domesness. At 4a.m. a very heavy squall laid her completley on her broadside. Gale continuing, five miles up the strand found it impossible to clear the land on any tack and in order to save their lives were obliged to run her on the strand. The sea was beating over her and fruitless attempts were made to get a line ashore. The following morning, weather having abated, they got on shore. Saw no prospect of getting vessel off, but saved her sails, ropes and part of cargo in damaged state. Crew all well and are to be sent home by British Consul.

Last evening the brig PLOUGHMAN of Aberdeen and the schooner JANE GWYNNE of Aberystwyth went ashore at the mouth of Aberdeen harbour. It is expected both will be got off.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 15/12/1883:
Disastrous gale, Aberdeen - about 4 o'clock the storm seemed to have reached a climax and the schooner LUNA, berthed at Queen's Jetty opposite Waterloo Railway Station, drifted across the dock and ran into the brig PLOUGHMAN with violence sufficient to break in two the vessel's foreyard.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 19/01/1894:
Great storm - no information has been yet received regarding the brig PLOUGHMAN, which was on a voyage from London to Aberdeen, and must have been caught in the storm. The SS COUNTESS of Aberdeen reports having sighted a brig which looked like the PLOUGHMAN making for the Humber. A number of relatives of the crew are naturally anxiously awaiting tidings. Mr. W. R. Aitkin, the local agent, is of opinion that Captain Christie held to sea when the storm burst and that he will soon arrive at some port. The names of the men on board are Captain Christie, George Smith, George Thomson, James Davidson and Wm. Hudson.

Aberdeen Press & Journal, 14/5/1845:
Launch - On Friday afternoon, a beautiful iron clipper-schooner, of 240 tons, was launched from the building yard of Messrs Wm. Simpson & Co. She is the property of the Old Leith and London Shipping Co., and intended for the Leith and London trade, to sail under the command of Captain Jordan, who is so well known and respected in that trade. The vessel received her name, ""THE PRINCE OF WALES"", from Miss Jordan, who performed the ceremony usual on such occasions. The Prince is admitted, on all hands, to be the handsomest craft of the kind ever launched here, and is a worthy successor to the Queen steamer, built lately by the same enterprising company. The beautiful models, both of the Queen and Prince, say a great deal for the advance of science in this department at our port.

South Australian Advertiser [Adelaide], 22/11/1861:
Cleared 21 No. PRINCEZA, 141 tons, C. Smerdon Master, for Guam [pacific Islands], no passengers.

Launceston Examiner, 02/04/1863:
Brigantine PRINCEZA wrecked while attempting to enter Moreton Bay, Queensland, on 15 March. Was of 141 tons, under command of Capt. Sayers, had been built Aberdeen 1850 and has been for only a short time on the intercolonial trade [i.e. around Australia]. She was owned by Nicolson & Co. of Melbourne. Both crew and cargo saved. Cargo consisted of hay, oats, wheat and small quantity of spirits. Following account of wreck kindly forwarded by Capt. Sayers:- She sailed from Port Frederick, Tasmania, 26 February. Entering Moreton Bay made his way for the entrance as marked on chart, feeling his way with the lead. Suddenly water shoaled from 5 to 3 fathoms, he then tried to near ship, but being a long vessel she would not get off readily and soon after struck. Very little damage was done at this first grounding. Probably she would have got off sagely had tide not been on ebb. Vessel moved several times during the day. Captain considered lightening vessel by throwing cargo overboard. Weather moderating somewhat, boat was launched. It overturned, but was righted. It was not large enough to carry whole crew, so master and 2 seamen volunteered to stay aboard. Boat subsequently returned for them. Ship was left beached on Amity Point."

Aberdeen Journal, 02/06/1826:
For sale by public roup at Lemon Tree Tavern, one eighth part of schooner PROSPECT of Aberdeen.

Newcastle Courant, 04/01/1850:
North Shields, 2 Jan. - schooner PROSPECT, which sailed from hence for Aberdeen on Saturday with coal and whiting, put back to our harbour on 31st with loss of mast, shanchens, boats and bulwarks. She had made the lights of Aberdeen, but no steamer being able to get off from that port [to tow her in], she was obliged in her disabled condition to run for the south. Supposed she will have to discharge to repair damage.

Aberdeen Journal, 09/07/1851:
Schooner PROSPECT, of Aberdeen, discharging cargo of flour at Glasgow, had a plank between quay and a wooden stage near mouth of hold. In hurry of discharging rise of tide was not noticed and plank suddenly fell from quay. Two men were on plank. One, a seaman named Morgan, was thrown into hold and much hurt, though it is hoped not dangerously. The other, a grain carrier, was jerked into water between vessel and quay. He was caught in mud in 6 or 7 feet water. It would have speedily been over him had not Mate of PROSPECT cast off shoes and dived into water at point he had disappeared. Next instant the Mate rose to surface carrying the muddy grain carrier.

Aberdeen Journal, 26/08/1851:
To be sold by public roup at Aberdeen all and whole schooner PROSPECT, of Aberdeen, with all her stores and appurtenances. She, having undergone very extensive repairs last year, is in excellent condition, well found in stores and carries large cargo. Particulars from Capt. Alex Leask, 43 Wales St. [repeated 12.09/1851 - ""well worth attention of parties requiring a handy craft""]."

Aberdeen Journal, 18th April 1827:
'On Thursday last we had the gratification of being present at the launch of the first steam vessel which has been built at this port.  If we may judge by the admiration which this magnificent ship had excited, among naval and scientific persons, as well as those acquainted with steam navigation, we may safely pronounce her the finest of her class not only for a frame of timber which cannot be surpassed, but which has been put together in a manner that would do credit to any King's dockyards.  Her length is that of a 36-gun frigate, she has a spar deck and poop, with two splendid cabins, separate from the sleeping compartments, which are ranged along the side of the ship, and all entering from the main deck.  These berths have removing stanchions, which, if necessary would enable her to carry 15 guns on a side.  She will be propelled by two engines of 75 horse-power each, and is calculated to carry, beside her machinery, fuel etc, three hundred tons.  
Not withstanding the unfavourable state of the weather from the incessant rain, a vast concourse of spectators had assembled at an early hour, and seemed delighted with the beautiful airs played by the Band of the Aberdeen Militia.  At a quarter past one o'clock, the Queen of Scotland majestically glided into her future element, amidst the cheers of the multitude, the band playing ""God Save the King"".  
This superb vessel has been built by Messrs J. Duffus & Co and her engines constructed at their extensive establishment here; and if the Queen of Scotland is to be considered a fair specimen of their work, it will bear a comparison with that of any of her class in the kingdom.  The launch was conducted by Mr Ronald, the master builder, in a style which did him much credit; and we were much pleased to observe the accommodation afforded by the proprietors of the neighbouring dock-yards, whose servants appeared to vie with each other in rendering every assistance in their power on this novel occasion.  We sincerely wish Messrs Duffus & Co every success in the prosecution of this now most important branch of nautical science.'

Aberdeen Press and Journal, 19/01/1870:
Launch of an iron screw steamer - Yesterday afternoon there was launched from the building yard of Messrs Leckie, Wood and Munro, Torry, a fine large iron screw steamer of 1200 tons register. Her measurement is as follows: - Length, 240 feet; breadth, 31 feet; depth, 19 and half feet. The vessel made a beautiful launch, of which an admirable view was obtained from the point of the Inches, and either parts of the harbour, by a large number of spectators. Miss Leckie performed the christening ceremony in graceful style, and named the vessel ""RAINTON"". She is the property of Mr William Scott, of Newcastle, and Mr Peter Brantingham, of London, and is intended for the Mediterranean trade. She leaves for Sunderland in a few days, to be fitted there, by Mr. George Clark, with high pressure surface and condensing engines, with 40 inch cylinders for working at 45lbs. The RAINTON will be commanded by Captain Reid, of Sunderland. This vessel is larger, we believe, than any ship yet built at Aberdeen. It is gratifying to know that her builders have orders to build another large iron vessel for Messrs Priest & Massie, of Hull. We are very sorry to learn that, notwithstanding the advantageous nature of the site occupied by Messrs Leckie, Wood and Munro, for building and launching large vessels, they entertain serious intentions of quitting the place, and carrying their enterprise to the south. All that is wasted, we believe, to induce the firm to remain, is better ferry boat accommodation. Messrs Leckie, Wood and Munro, we believe, employ nearly 250 workmen, of which number fully one-half reside on the north side of the river, and are not taken across to their work any day in less time than half an hour. Then, for the next two or three years, a large number of men will be employed in connection with the harbour works. All these would contribute towards the establishment of a regular steam ferry, and once established, doubtless others would be tempted to take advantage of the sites for building yards afforded at Torry. If Torry is to be made available in this respect, it must be by the establishment of a suitable ferry.

Aberdeen Press and Journal, 9/2/1870:
The new iron steamer ""RENTON"" [misspelling of RAINTON, or RAINTON may be a misspelling of RENTON], built by Messrs Leckie, Wood and Munro, left for Newcastle, in tow of two tug boats, one from Newcastle and the other belonging to this port, on Thursday, and on Saturday she was towed into Holy Island for shelter, by the Newcastle tug, the Aberdeen on having previously left her.

Morning Post, 18/3/1873:
With sea running mountains high at entrance to Fowey Harbour, large steamer was seen off Gribben Head signalling for a pilot. Guns were fired to warn her to keep off rocks to east of Fowey Harbour. Pilots at danger to their lives managed to board the vessel, Newcastle steamer RAINTON, and brought her into harbour. However, she collided with 3 vessels on way in. She was 23 days out from Alexandria for London with cargo of 1500 tons maize etc. and short of coals. Damage was done to deck fittings etc.

Standard, 1/10/1873:
RAINTON was in collision with BLANCHIE MARIE, of Kristiana, which put into Elsinore 24 Sept. with planks, bulwarks etc. damaged.

Despite the inscription on the commemorative rummer glass, which clearly states 'Schooner Ranger lost off Aberdeen, 1st Sept. 1833', contemporary accounts have the vessel stranded on Goodwin Sands in gales.

The Morning Post (London, England), Tuesday, September 03, 1833; Issue 19575
""DEAL, SEPT. 1.- ...FIVE P.M.- Another crew is just landed belonging to 
the Ranger, from Caen to Sunderland; the vessels were totally lost, and 
I fear, from the severity of the gale, many more have suffered.""

The Standard (London, England), Wednesday, September 04, 1833; Issue 1970
""RAMSGATE, SEPT. 2.- ... The Ranger of Sunderland, reported as riding in 
a dangerous situation near the Goodwin Sands, is gone to pieces. Crew 
saved. Several anchors and chains have been picked up and landed here 
today.""

The following transcript is from a copy of a letter provided by Susan Enns, independent researcher and relative of John and Barbara CHRISTIE:

'...the vessel proved to be the Ranger, a schooner from Caen to Sunderland in ballast.  She was riding with two anchors ahead on the North sand head. A dangerous part of the Goodwin and owing to the incessant shifting of the ballast producing a terrible rolling of the schooner, the boat could not board her but by skilful management and after surmounting many difficulties went under her stern. 

Such was the sense of desolation and distress that nothing could exceed the desperate situation of the vessel and nothing was left under providence, but the unshrinking firmness and skill of the boatmen to save the crew from destruction. A rope was speedily thrown from the vessel which secured the vessel to the boat, and afterward by means of a lead line, each of the crew consisting of four men and a boy, was dragged in succession through the waves. The boy cried bitterly before he was plunged into the water.

An accident of peculiar interest, deserves to be recorded hereafter.  The boatmen had in vain sought a suitable juncture to board her and had repeatedly passed round the vessel.  A seaman on board the schooner held up the boy in his arms, the appeal was irresistible, and the boatmen were resolved to face every danger to preserve the crew. Sept. 1st 1833.'

Glasgow Herald, 31/05/1844:
Shipwreck - schooner RED ROVER, of Aberdeen, drove ashore 17 May at Scrabster. Men, immediately took to the boat. One of coastguard men, David Horne, gallantly sprung into the breakers and caught hold of the boat until men landed. That morning while getting under way block of main sheet struck Captian on head and laid him insensible - now recovering. Vessel was bound for Africa for cargo of guano and had 2 years' provisions aboard (safely laned on fall on tide).

See ""The Tea Clippers"" 1833-1875, by David R. McGregor (p. 51) for plan of REINDEER.

Aberdeen Journal, January 22nd 1851:
When compared with an American ship 'Oriental' which made passage between Canton to London in 98 '...the ""Reindeer"" an Aberdeen clipper, of 328 tons, which sailed from China about the same time, which with her copper hanging loose about her, and carrying 500 tons of cargo, was only beaten five days in the passage from Anjeer...'

Maitland Mercury, 10/8/1850: 
Clipper ship Reindeer, capt. Enright, arrived in Mersey from China with cargo of tea after being absent only 8 months. We believe this to be the shortest voyage on record between this port and the celestial empire (from Liverpool journal).

Gelong Advertiser (Victoria), 18/8/1855:
Hobsow's Bay - arrived reiwdeer, ship, from Tome (Chile).

Sydney Empire, 15/9/1855:
Ship Reindeer from Melbourne to China, spoken off Wilison's Promontory (near Melbourne). 

Melbourne Argus, 18/1/1856:
Report by Capt. Edward Storey - report loss of ship Reindeer on reef lat.10S, 155E. At midnight on 26 September (1855). at 11.30pm Forecastle lookout reported breakers on Lee Bow. Helm was immediately put hard a port. Found she would not weather it. Shortly after she struck with enormous crash and immediately filled to level of water outside. The rollers breaking against weather side, it was impossible for her to stand long. Cut the masts away in order to get boats out. Long boat was only one left. We succeeded in getting her over the side with a little bread, 19 gallons water, a set of instruments and the ship's papers.
At daylight on 27th made out group of rocks about 8 miles to Leeward on North side of reef. We landed on largest of them and rigged a tent with the oars an an old sail. Following morning visited the old ship to obtain a little more bread and water and some old planking to deck boat. We found the ship breaking up fast. After remaining on rock for nine days preparing boat to cross the trades for East coast of Australia, on 11 october, 19 hands in number, we left the reef and stood westward. Found water clear of reef too heavy for boat and immediately threw everything overboard except a little bread and water and one set instruments. Bore away for Trinity Bay on coast of Australia. Served out half a biscuit and half pint water each.
After 28 days living on shellfish and water ( procured on islands) we arrived Port Curtis.  
18 November scarcely able  to walk up beach. Everything the settlememt could afford was brought down for our relief (some of crew being almost at death's door). Remained at Port Curtis for 6 weeks until departure of the Sabio Chief for Sydney, where we arrived 8 January. Regret owner of Sabio Chief should have detained remaing effects of a shipwrecked crew for payment of their passage."

The following extracts from the Memorable Order of Tin Hats newsletter [http://www.moth.org.za/images/BullsheetFebruary2011.pdf]

The Richard Bennett, the oldest trawler to be requisitioned for naval service had also served as a naval vessel in World War One, the only one in the SDF to have done so, apart from the Stork – an examination vessel that served at East London and later Durban.

26th October 1954 Sunk as a target. 
'...as part of the general disposal of old vessels she was taken out of service in 1954 and on 26 October was towed out to sea to serve as a target for the three 9.2-inch guns of the De Waal Battery (previously Robben Island Battery). She seemed somehow forlorn as the tug GS Stephens, “…left her wallowing in the strong south-west swell.” She finally went to the bottom after 23 rounds had been fired at her.'"

RIFLEMAN left London 28th December 1872.  

In March 1873, en route to Sydney, Australia, Captain Longmuir, a native of Stonehaven was beaten to death while he slept by the steward, a German named Wilhelm Kraus, aka William Cross.  The first mate, George Morgan, another Stonehaven man, was lured into the Captain’s cabin by the killer and attacked, but managed to overpower the steward and grappled him to the ground as he produced a pistol and tried to shoot him.  The killer was kept tied up in the wheelhouse as Morgan proceeded to master the ship successfully to Sydney.  The captain’s body was kept in a barrel of spirits and buried at Sydney.  Kraus was tried and convicted and hung the same year. It seems he had also tried to poison the entire crew and there was speculation that he had intended to take over the ship.  He pleaded insanity at the trial and claimed not to remember the incident; however, he was found guilty and hanged.
George Morgan, who had so successfully taken control of the ship, went on to marry Ann Duthie, the sister of ship’s owner, William Duthie.  Captain Longmuir had been due to take charge of the new Duthie ship, also named Ann Duthie, on his return to Britain, however, this then went to George Morgan.

Melbourne Argus, 06/06/1873:
At Central Criminal Court, Sydney, William Cross (otherwise Wilhelm Krauss) found guilty of murder of Capt. James Longmuir on board British ship Rifleman whilst ship was a few hundred miles off the South American coast on 16 March.  Plea of insanity rejected and Cross sentenced to death.
Judge said ""you availed yourself of your position of Steward of the ship to mingle narcotic poison in the cabin food and grog served out that night to the crew.  Capt. Longmuir appears never to have stirred in his bed nor resisted either the savage blow by which you fractured his skull or the fatal cord with which you strangled his dying breath.  The seven other cords found on the same night ready to your hand in your own pantry, the revolvers and dagger found upon you, the long iron bolt with which you attacked the Chief Officer and the General stupefaction of the ship's crew who had drunk the grog all prove beyond the slightest that yours was a cunningly devised plan to obtain possession of the ship.  No evidence to implicate a single individual on board that ship"".

Aberdeen Journal, 09/07/1873:
Well attended meeting of shipmasters and others connected with the trade of the port of Sydney was held aboard the ship ANN DUTHIE. Mr Williams stated meeting had been called to convey the family of the late Captain Longmuir sympathy in their great bereavement [poisoned by ship's steward]. Chairman spoke at some length on high character of deceased and hoped those who knew him would lighten the heavy blow fallen on widow and orphan children. Captain Moodie proposed and Captain Benzie (ANN DUTHIE) seconded resolution that subscription be raised - £300 already received.

Aberdeen Journal, 10/09/1873:
No clue as to motive for killing of Captain and attempted murder of rest of crew. Theory has been advanced that Krauss [the murderer] had some hope of obtaining sole possession of the vessel, running in upon the coast of Brazil, in order to secure everything valuable in the ship and then abandoning her.

Serious accidents have befallen the ROYAL TAR, Irish steamer from London to Dublin.  At Plymouth she was detained 6 hours repairing the paddle boxes.  At Falmouth she caught fire, but it was soon extinguished.  On Thursday at 1pm, rather foggy at Arklow, 50 miles from Dublin, she went on the shoals.  One of the passengers writes ""The crying, bellowing and confusion of the passengers could not be equalled.  As soon as the boats came off they threw themselves into them, leaving luggage and everything behind.  Some broken bones etc. took place but no lives lost.  Some threw themselves overboard and swam to the boats.  I found myself at 7 o'clock the only passenger aboard, so with the Captain and Crew we worked all night, got anchors out and at five in the morning she floated off, with seven feet of water in the hold.  We got on board 60 or 70 raw Irishmen to work the pumps, hired a schooner to tow us and got into Dublin on Friday night.  All the passengers lost their luggage which was pillaged by the Irish.""

The yacht schooner Salamander, property of Earl of Selkirk, has been taken into drydock in Malta. She was found to be so loosly put together that her safe arrival here from England may be considered miraculous. This was her first trip. Her lordship had paid the full, £23 per ton, Aberdeen, she had undergone the survery of Lloyd's agents. 
[According to builders list contract price was £5000, so £23 p.t. reasonably accurate, based on register tonnage. There can be no suggestion this was a cheap job. Hall's yard no. 208 (1857) was a schooner of very similar size (105 ft length, gt 155), named 'The Oak'. Her contract price was £2600, slightly over half that of 'Salamander'. The difference could, of course, be explained by quality + extent of fittings.]

Salamander returned to England in Mid 1857 - 17 days Malta to Gibraltar via Tunis, sailed from Gibraltar 25 June (Hampshire Telegraph, 04/07/1857), c. 09/07/1857 arrived Yarmouth and then moved to Southampton ""to be thoroughly overhauled"" (Isle of Wight Observer, 11/07/1857)."

Built along the same lines as her predecessor THERMOPYLAE, although her spars were reputed to be one foot longer all round.  Alhough intended for the same tea routes as THERMOPYLAE she actually made her name as a wool clipper, the tea being carried by steamers by the time she was built. 

Between 1875 and 1894 she has only two masters, Captains Phillips, senior and junior, the first mate and third mates were also sons of Captain Phillips at one time. In 1894 Captain R B B McKilliam became master.

Newcastle Morning Herald, 23/8/1895:
Salamis, still under command of Captain McKilliam, has arrived Melbourne, having left London 30 May, after landing pilot at start point, June. She had short stretch of WSW winds but soon ran into NNE, which lasted until 19 June, when she fell in with South East Trades in latitude 7 degrees North. Crossing equator on 23 June, she was soon beset by heavy SE gale, which continued for 5 days. Meridan of Cape of Good Hope was passed 18 July and in running down her easting NW, W, SW winds. Later on Salamis had a second opportunity of displaying her ability to successfully cope with hurricane weather, on 2 August. A storm from West blew with great fury for several days, violent squalls and prodigious seas contributing to general unpleasantness of the situation, decks were almost continually under water, but Salamis acted splendidly throughout and emerged from the ordeal relatively uninjured.

Newcastle Morning Herald, 25/4/1953:
The Salamis Story - Salamis was in her lifetime rated fastest row sailing ship. This beautiful clipper was intended to follow traditional clipper route - outward to Melbourne with general cargo, across Pacific with coal to China and home with first teas of the season. However, soon the first teas were taken by steamers and Salamis had to make her name as a colonial clipper. She enjoyed a long and popular career in the Melbourne wool trade. On May 20 1905, she was wrecked on Malden Island in the South Pacific,

Aberdeen Press & Journal, Wednesday 13 March 1974:
'Trendy Trawler' by Jim Kinnaird
'A Peterhead skipper's girlfriend launched her husband-to-be's new command - the seiner-trawler Salamis at Aberdeen yesterday.
The 86ft boat, built at the Torry shipyard of John Lewis & Sons Ltd., was sent smartly on her way to the sea by Miss Anne Mair, who is to wed skipper Thomas Milne, jun., on June 1st.
Anne, a secretary-typist at Crosse & Blackwell's Peterhead factory, is herself a fisherman's daughter.  She swung the traitional bottle against the bows in fine style - and was rewarded with a gold watch as a memento, handed over by the shipyard's managing director, Mr James S. Smith.
Skipper Milne's partners in the venture are his brothers Adam, George and Alexander and Bruce's Stores (Aberdeen) Ltd.
His present boat is the wooden-hulled Starella, which is to be taken over by his father.
Skipper Milne said he had decided to go for the larger steel vessel because this class of ship was needed to meet the trend in fishing today.
Salamis is an up-dated version of the Torry-built Peterhead seiner-trawlers Seringa and Sundarj, which have proved highly succesful vessels.
She should be ready for service next month and will be equipped for both white fish and herring catching.
The vessel is designed for starboard side trawling and for seining and an additional gallows is fitted to the port side aft to enable her to go pair trawling.
Like many of the new seiners in service, rope bins are fitted at the forward end of the fishroom - a safety feature which eliminates the need for coiling ropes.
The fishroom itself has a capacity of 120 cu. metres and is completely insulated and lined on sides, bulkheads and deckhead.
It is arranged for carrying fish boned at sea and can be rearranged for bulk fishing.
The Salamis' main engine is a 636bhp Mirrlees Blackstone with bridge control.  Provision is made to operate it at 240rpm while seining.'

Renamed HARVEST REAPER in 1982, and SHALIMAR in 1995.

SALMAID was one of three vessels built for the Admiralty by Hall Russells. The other two were SALMASTER and SALMOOR.  They were equipped with a heavy lift jib on the fore deck in front of the wheelhouse.  An ""A"" type box fitted on top of the wheelhouse at the apex of the A-frame. A box section was fitted at the top A-frame with a heavy duty swivel sheave where the jibs wires ran through.  Where the crane did all the lifting heavy oak timber was fitted to protect the hull.  The timber had to be shaped to the contours of the bow. They were fitted from the deck to the waterline at an angle.  The ship was sold in 2012 and renamed KOMMANDER CALUM. Two horns were fixed on the bow for lifting buoys for inspection. No further informaiton of new owners.

SALMASTER was one of three salvage vessels built for the Admiralty by Hall Russells. The other two were SALMOOR and SALMAID, which have also been sold to private companies.  They were fitted with a heavy lift jib on the fore deck with a post on the starboard and portside of the wheelhouse front, which were fitted with heavy lift sheaves to take the wires from the jib.  On the bow there was a horn port and starboard that protrude over the bow to lift buoys or heavy anchors. At the bow, port and starboard, a section of oak timber was fitted to protect the hull when the crane was lifting heavy loads. As they were fitted at the bow each one had to be shaped to match the contour shape of the hull, and were set at an angle from the deck to the waterline.  
The ship was sold in 2001 to Gardline Surveys, Lowestoft, UK. 
It had 2 oil engines with clutch flex coupling and DR gear CP props, total power 2,984KW (4056HP) Ruston 2 x Vee 4 stroke 8cy, 254x305 each Ruston Diesels. 1 bow thruster fuel 242.0 (D.O.), 2 decks.

SALMOOR was one of three vessels built for the Admiralty by Hall Russell.  The others were SALMAID and SALMASTER.  They were equipped with a heavy lift crane jib on the fore deck in front of the wheelhouse.  A box ""A""-frame was situated on top of the wheelhouse and a box fixed into the apex of the A-frame where a heavy duty swivel sheave was fixed for the jib wires.  On the side of the ship where the crane did the lifting heavy oak timber was fitted to protect the hull from getting damaged. As it was on the bow the timber had to be fitted to the contour of the ship and was set at an angle from the deck to the waterline. The ship was renamed KOMMANDER IONA in 2012 (no information on the new owners). On the bow a set of horns overhang the bow for lifting buoys out of the water for inspection.

Ship SAMUEL PLIMSOLL arrived Tuesday at Melbourne from London (Gravesend 5 July). Owing to strong SW gale anchor was dropped in Downs for 3 days. At first slow progress in light variable winds. Eventually picked up NE trades, which proved very shy, but carried her to latitude 12 deg. N, when a SW monsoon sprang up and carried ship to equator, crossed 15 August. Ship soon went into SW trades, which proved moderate. Cape of Good Hope was passed 1st Sept. and strong gale was met with on this date. Furious squalls of hail broke over the ship, high confused sea got up, which flooded decks fore and aft. This lasted 21 hours. Succession of heavy gales from WSW marked ship's progress to Cape Lewin. She made good daily runs at this period, maximum 16 Sept., when she ran 301 miles in 24 hours. Light winds from Cape Lewin to Otway.

One of the best known, as well as one of the fastest identified with the trade between the Old Country and Australia, the SAMUEL PLIMSOLL of the Aberdeen Line, was towed into Sydney. She set sail from Melbourne to London 9 days ago.

Western Australian, 18/11/1898:
With cargo of 4,329 bales wool, 6,993 bags concentrates and 926 bags ore, was going through the Straits when she fell in with pretty heavy gale. Having little on her but topsails and foresail everything looked snug enough, but an ugly cross sea was running. Without slightest warning snap went the foretopmast back stay and down came the spar, wrecking a portion of bulwarks and falling over the side. It also carried away jib boom and broke off short the main royalmast - forward end of ship became scene of utmost confusion and it was then seen that foretopmast had snapped. The miracle is that mass of wreckage falling from a great height missed killing some unlucky seaman. Course set for Sydney.

Inquirer and Commercial News (Perth, W.A.), 09/06/1899:
London, 2 June - fire broken out yesterday in after hold of iron ship SAMUEL PLIMSOLL in London Docks. Considerable damage done before flames subdued. She had left Sydney 31 December and arrived London 13 April.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 05/04/1900:
[Last reference] ""SAMUEL PLIMSOLL"", ship, passed Beachy Head 4 April from Sydney for London.

Sydney Evening News, 02/10/1902:
Auckland, NZ - SAMUEL PLIMSOLL has been towed into Gisborne [NZ North Island] with only one mast standing. She was bound from Glasgow to Dunedin. After passing Nuggets Point, Otage, then being 91 days out, she was blown out to sea. When hove to she began to roll heavily and main and mizzen masts went by the board. Very anxious fortnight followed, men were kept frequently at the pumps and there is still 11 inches water in main hold. Foremast is very shaky, but it carried sufficient sail to allow Captain to make the coast.

Sydney Evening News, 22/04/1903:
Latterly under Aberdeen White Star Line Captain Henderson took charge of SAMUEL PLIMSOLL and remained with her until she was sold to Messrs. Shaw, Savill & Co., who placed her in the New Zealand trade, where she recently came to grief. She has been so badly knocked about that it has been decided not to refit her and that she will become a coal hulk. She now lies at Port Jackson, NSW. [Claims she had averaged 80 days on passage UK - Australia].


Launched from Hood's yard at Aberdeen in September 1873, with her namesake present to watch the event, the Samuel Plimsoll was the third iron clipper ordered for George Thompson's Aberdeen White Star Line's growing fleet of emigrant ships. 

Registered in London at 1,510 tons gross (1,444 net) and measuring 241 feet in length with a 39 foot beam, she sported a full ship-rig and was completed as ""a double topgallant yarder."" 

Specially fitted out for the emigrant trade, she left Plymouth on 19th November 1873 with 180 passengers and arrived in Port Jackson, Australia, on 1st February the following year. Despite light winds at the start of her outward passage, she made the run in a creditable 73 days, including one splendid dash of 340 miles in 24 hours when approaching Tasmania. 

From the outset she proved herself a very fast ship, with her best-ever performance being Sydney to the Bishop's Rock lighthouse in 68 days under Captain Henderson, albeit later in her career. 

She remained in the Sydney trade until 1887 when she was transferred to the Melbourne run, all the time continuing to carry 3-400 emigrants on the voyage out and a full cargo of wool back to the UK. 

A prominent and well-known vessel in the so-called Wool Fleet, the famous old ship caught fire in the Thames in 1899 and had to be scuttled. Subsequently raised and repaired, she was sold to Savills who operated her until 1902 when she was dismasted and so damaged on passage to Port Chalmers, New Zealand, that she was deemed not worth repairing. Eventually towed to Sydney at the end of a 120-fathom hawser, she ended her days as a coal hulk in Fremantle harbour.

Captain James Nicol Forbes (former captain of the ships MARCO POLO & LIGHTNING) with his crew and 430 passengers left Liverpool on 6th October 1855 carrying cargo for the Geelong Railway.

Wrecked 25th December 1855, 40 miles off Cape Otway, Victoria, Australia on maiden voyage.  Stranded on a sand bank at Peterborough, Australia.  All passengers rescued and taken aboard a passing steamer QUEEN. Passenger's luggage and some cargo was rescued, however, this was abandoned as the weather worsened.  The wreck was sold to local merchants for salvage and two were drowned attempting to reach the wreck.

Courier (Hobart, Tas.), Monday 31st December 1855:
WRECK of the Royal Mail Clipper Ship ""SCHOMBERG"":
An expectant crowd of citizens congregated last evening at the Post Office awaiting the arrival of the Launceston coach, which it was hoped would bring in the Hobart Town portion of the ""Schomberg"" mails, and a feeling of deep disappointment and sympathy was excited to find that the noble vessel had been wrecked within a few hours sail of her destination.
The details of the melancholy disaster did not arrive, the only particulars which transpired being as follows:-
The Black Swan steamer arrived on Saturday, and Captain Woods obtained the intelligence of the wreck, 5 miles from Cape Otway, from the steamer Queen from port Fairy, which was met near the Port Phillip Heads with a number of the passengers of the Schomberg on board. It was anticipated, however, that the Maid of the Yarrs would reach Launceston today with the mail, if saved, and full particulars may be received.
FURTHER PARTCULARS:
By the arrival of the steamer Ant, Captain Thompson, which left Geelong on the 28th instant, we learn that the Schomberg ran ashore about forty miles west of Cape Otway. It appears that while the captain of the vessel was attempting to wear her round, she missed stays, and drifted ashore upon Curtis's Inlet.
At about thee o'clock on Thursday morning, the Captain of the Queen steamer answering the signals of distress fired from the Schomberg, bore down to her, took all the passengers and mails on board, and brought them safely to Port Phillip; without one loss of life.

The inquiry into the wreck and the trial of Captain Forbes acquitted him of neglect of duty.

The SCHOMBERG is protected as an Historic Shipwreck.  It is popular with wreck divers and many relics from the wreck are now on display at the Flagstaff Hill Maritime Museum, Victoria, Australia.  See the 'Useful Links' page for a complete account of the wreck.

The Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, Friday 8th February 1856:
THE SCHOMBERG.
At a meeting of passengers by the Schomberg, held at Melbourne on the 3rd instant, at the Mechanics' Institute, the following resolutions were unanimously carried:
1st. That the conduct of the captain, the surgeon and some of the officers of the Schomberg was ungentlemanly, discourteous and grossly immoral.
2nd. That it was not only the general impression of the passengers of the Schomberg, but to the certain knowledge of many of those here assembled, that the loss of that fine ship can only be attributed to the gross negligence of the captain.
3rd. That we are of opinion that the contracts entered into between Messrs. James Haines & Co., of Liverpool, and the passengers of the Schomberg have not been fulfilled.
4th. That a deputation be appointed to wait upon His Excellency the Office Administering the Government, praying that an investigation be held into the circumstances of the loss of the Schomberg, and the property of the passengers.

The Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, Friday 8th February 1856:
WRECK OF THE SCHOMBERG
To the editor of the S. A. Register.
Dear Sir, - You will no doubt, have heard of the royal mail ship Schomberg being on shore about 80 miles to the westward of Cape Otway. As she lay directly in my course to Adelaide, I thought it my duty to pay her a visit, if peradventure; I could render any assistance in saving lives or property. In the course of the afternoon of Friday we arrived within a short distance, the weather being then fine. I proceeded on board, and found her lying in a perilous position. The following account of the disaster is given me by Captain Forbes, who poor fellow, feels his position a sad one: -
About midnight on Wednesday, the 26th instant, fine weather, light easterly wind. Sighted the land about three miles eastward of his present position. Put the ship off on the shore tack. When the sails had scarcely been filled, it fell quite calm; and from the prevalence of easterly winds, the current was running strong to the westward, with a swell heaving in shore. In this perilous position the sails caught aback, and before they got her in a position to be manageable, the vessel struck aft, and heeled round, with her head in shore, where she now lies, with about 18 feet at the stern, and 12 feet forward. The passengers and some of the luggage have been sent on to Melbourne per steamers Queen and Champion, wither Captain Forbes has sent for assistance for everything available in the shape of steam to save his noble ship; and, unless this is promptly attended to, the weather prove fine, nothing can save her from being a total wreck. Very little of the cargo will be saved in a sound condition. She has on board a quantity of the Geelong, Melbourne, and Hobson's Bay Railway plan, carriages, etc.
The vessel, with the provisions for the voyage out and home, cost £60,000, and, I understand is not fully insured. The freight list amounts to £35,000. She is without exception the noblest piece of naval architecture I ever looked upon.
You will find a description of her in the sheet published for her on the morning of her departure from Liverpool. She left Liverpool on the 6th October, and passed Queenstown on the 9th; from that to the equator, 28 days; light baffling winds from lat. 8 deg. N. to the line; she only made 40 miles per day. The south-east trades, unusual at this time of the year, hung so far to the southward that at one time they thought they would be obliged to tack to clear the coast of Brazil. In latitude 24 degrees S., becalmed 14 days; then comes a run which shows what the Schomberg can do under favourable circumstances.
From the meridian of Greenwich up to 135 deg. E. long. only occupied 19 days - or sailing at an average of 423 miles per day, but from the last mentioned long. they experienced light easterly winds and calms up to the time she struck. Messrs, Fenn, Hawker, and families, were passengers for Adelaide.
I remained by the vessel until dark, and finding I could be of no service single-handed, proceeded on our passage. A fresh breeze at west sprang up at midnight, and having continued unfavourable, has retarded our passage. Enclosed I hand you the latest news I could procure.
I am, Sir, &c.,
James Lawrence.

Courier (Hobart, Tas.), Friday 29th February, 1856:
LOSS OF THE SCHOMBERG, THE ACQUITTAL OF CAPTAIN FORBES.
A collection of letters has been published in the Melbourne Morning Herald, addressed to Captain Forbes, the late commander of the Schomberg, in answer to what he and his friends denounce as the calumnious charges and insinuations made against him, in public and in private. One of these letters which we subjoin, in from John Walker, Esq. who with a portion of his family were passengers by the ill-fated ship. Our readers will not be insensible to the weight which, from Mr. Walker's well known integrity of character, attaches to his evidence.
Hobart Town, 9th Jan. 1856.
Dear Sir, - I fully intend to address you before I left Melbourne, but was too much hurried to do so, and I take the earliest opportunity, after my arrival here, to express my sympathy under your present unfortunate circumstances.
I regret to say the unfortunate loss of the noble ship Schomberg appeared to be a cause of rejoicing to several parties in Melbourne, for as soon as the steamer which took all the passengers arrived at the Wharf, at Sandridge, our captain called out to a well-dressed person, who was standing on the Wharf, ""The Schombeg is a wreck"", and the wretch clapped his hands and danced for joy, and ran on board the steamer bound for Sydney to tell the news. I saw too much of the same spirit manifested by parties from whom better things might have been expected, which led me to conclude that you had become an object of envy, on account of the successful voyages you had made to and from the colony. It is stated in an ancient work, 'Anger is cruel, and wrath is outrageous, but who can stand before envy!'.
I was thoroughly disgusted when I heard the malicious and unfounded statements which were industriously circulated in Melbourne, they must have come from some polluted source, and I do not believe that any of the first saloon passengers had any concern in hatching such statements.
I can only say that all appeared highly gratified with your attention to the ship, as you were constantly at your post; and, although you were anxious to make a quick passage, there was no recklessness, as when we had wind, the ship was made all snug before night, and we all had the greatest confidence in the skill and ability of yourself and your officers.
The manner in which you behaved to the passengers was highly gratifying; you were kind and attentive to all, and did everything in your power to relieve the tedium of the voyage, by promoting amusements, and making all as happy as circumstances would allow.
I can bear testimony to your kindness to the second and third class passengers, having frequently seen you send wine to those who were old, infirm, and weak, as well as soups and meat from your own table to the sick; you were accessible to all, and frequently visited every part of the ship where passengers were.
With reference to my own family, I can only saw each one feels grateful for your kindness and attention, and will ever remember you, and trust that the cloud which now lowers over you may soon be dispelled, and that the sun of prosperity will ere long shine upon you, and that you may live down the calumny of your enemies.
I remain, dear Sir,
Yours very truly,
John Walker."

Brig Scotsman, Skeene, of Aberdeen, which sailed from Sunderland 2 October, coal laden, returned from sea on 4th in consequence of contrary winds. In attempting to enter the harbour too soon on the tide she struck the ground and sank. The materials are landed and cargo discharged.

Aberdeen Journal, 17/1/1849:
The late disasterous storm - brig was seen by the Boddam fishermen north of Buchan Ness to close to the shore to hope that she would clear that head. She foundered quite close to the land and from portions of wreck driven on shore we conclude it is the brig Scotsman, James Horn master, of Aberdeen. All the crew perished - no human aid could reach them. Captain Horn had a son aboard and beside them 5 other men have lost their lives.

(Source: Aberdeen Shipping Register (Aberdeen City Archives))

The schooner SCOTTISH MAID, built by the Hall shipyard in 1839, was the first vessel with the raked stem known as the 'Aberdeen bow'.   SCOTTISH MAID was intended for the Aberdeen-London trade, where speed was crucial to compete with steamships.  

The Hall brothers tested various hulls in a water tank and found the clipper design most effective.  The design was influenced by tonnage regulations.  Tonnage measured a ship's cargo capacity and was used to calculate tax and harbour dues.  

The new 1836 regulations measured depth and breadth with length measured at half midship depth.  Extra length above this level was tax-free and became a feature of clippers.  SCOTTISH MAID proved swift, regularly making the journey from Aberdeen to London in 49 hours, and reliable and the design was widely copied.

Aberdeen Journal, in 1848, described the construction of the first true Clipper Ship and what was to bcome known around the world as the Aberdeen Bow:

'The Messrs Hall commenced framing the schooner from aft, and continued the frames until they reached the fore end of the keel. 
Thus far the work had proceeded, when the builders suggested a deviation from the models, which they belived would proved to be a decided improvement. 
They proposed to run the stem out so as to form the cutwater, the effect of which would be to draw the waterlines finer at the bow and, as a natural consequence, the vessel would divide the water easily, be more buoyant forward, and of less register tonnage than if she were built on the old plan. 
The idea did not at first meet the views of the owners. A skeleton bow was then erected, and not a few of the curious examined it and were skeptial of the uncommon design. After due consideration, the owners gave consent to proceed with the vessel according to the skeleton model, and in that style she was finished and launched. 
The look of the schooner in the water was encouraging. It was evident from the appearance of her waterlines that the idea of a perfect bow was realized, and some of those who were at first opposed to the project were now among the warmest commendators.'

'THE SCOTTISH PRINCE - On July 6 an iron sailing ship was launched from the building-yard of Messrs. Alexander Hall and Co., Aberdeen, for Messrs. Mcllwraith, McEacharn, and Co., London, for the Scottish line of packet ships sailing from
London to Queensland. The vessel, which is named the SCOTTISH PRINCE, is of the following dimensions: Length, 210 ft.; breadth, 32ft. 6in.; depth of hold, 18ft. She is 950 tons register, and will be classed 100 A1 (highest class) at Lloyd's.'

Queensland Museum provides the following details:

A three masted iron hulled barque, the Scottish Prince was built by Alexander Hall & Sons in 1878.
She was an old trader to the colony, was the property of McIlwraith, McEachern & Company, and consigned to the firm D.L Brown & Coy in Australia.
She was wrecked in 1887 under the command of William Little, carrying a general cargo and migrants in the final stages on a voyage from Glasgow.
Now a popular attraction for divers, the wreck -  along with the nearby wreck of the Cambus Wallace (a Glasgow built iron barque wrecked in 1895), are known as the 'whiskey wrecks' because of the enormous quantities of whiskey which locals 'salvaged' from them at the time and still evident in-situ. The Museum has a large collection of objects in its collection (including full whiskey bottles!) related to this wreck including the ships bell.

A local crew boarded her, but Captain declined to land the people. 3 boats manned are lying by in case of emergency. 35 passengers are aboard.

Further unavailing attempts made to float barque SCOTTISH PRINCE. Wind shifted to south east and drove her further inshore. Steamers OTTER and GUNGA attempted to tow her off, but GUNGA'S hawser parted and fouled the screw. Weather has since been very unfavourable, seas breaking heavily over the ship, which it is believed will now be abandoned.

Newcastle Morning Herald, 08/02/1887:
Steamers GUNGA and OTTER have returned to Brisbane from stranded barque SCOTTISH PRINCE, bringing the crew and captain - when they left, the barque had 26 in. water in her hold. Mainmast was expected to go overboard at any moment. Vessel has now been abandoned and there is little chance of cargo being saved. Captain Little and two of the sailors at first refused to leave the ship, but afterwards signalled for a boat from the GUNGA. A boat was lowered and manned with great difficulty, Captain of barque threw 30 gallons of oil into the water and quietened the sea which had been boiling over the deck, boat then took them to GUNGA.

Newcastle Morning Herald, 18/02/1887:
Brisbane - Marine Board of opinion SCOTTISH PRINCE was being navigated much too close to the shore, that none of necessary precautions appeared to have been adopted, but on contrary appeared to have been navigated by rule of thumb. Discrepancies between chart and log book could not be explained in any satisfactory way. Board was of opinion attempt had been made to make log book and chart show vessel ought to have been in some other position than she actually was when she grounded. Log book was most carelessly kept and entries on log slate were not correct. Board therefore considered that vessel was lost through gross carelessness and most slovenly navigation and certificate of William Little, the Master, was cancelled. Certificate of A. F. Knowles, 1st Mate, is suspended for 6 months for making deficent and contradictory entries in log slate and log book.

Ross, during heavy storm an enormous sea towering 30 ft. above the deck rolled down the poop and washed overboard the second officer and helmsman and did much damage to the deck gear, smashed the wheel and carried away 4 boats.  Vessel was in fact a complete wreckage and large quantities of water poured down into her, although fortunately hatches remained intact.  For some time vessel appeared to be foundering and during a succession of heavy seas more of her crew were washed overboard, of course there was no chance of rescuing them.  By immense efforts the wreckage was cleared away and pumps set to work and next day the sea moderated.  Men lost are 2nd officer Mr G. W. Anderson, John Walter Edward Marsden and Henry Henderson (able seamen) and Thomas Mowatt, Carpenter.

Classed LR until 29 August 2001

SEA GRIFFON was one of two diesel tugs ordered by Aberdeen Harbour to replace the four steam powered tugs they had being DANNY, RIDGEWAY, GLEN and NESS. The other Tug was SEA TROJAN.

The SEA GRIFFON and SEA TROJAN were designed as harbour tugs to assist in the berthing of the large cargo ships that came in to the port to discharge their cargo. As bow thrusters were not developed they were also used to shift the discharged trawlers from the fishmarket to the lay up berths at Albert Quay and the launches at Lewis' and Russell's shipyards.

SEA GRIFFON and SEA TROJAN were propelled by a single propeller through a steerable kort nozzle runnder to give extra power. 

SEA GRIFFON has been layed up at Dundee Harbour since being sold in 1977 from AHB. The 2004 Lloyd's Register lists SEA GRIFFON owner as Coastal Marine but not being used.  She was still in Dundee as at 2012.  SEA TROJAN was still working at Heysham in 2012.

Aberdeen Press & Journal, 20/10/1869:
Wreck of two Aberdeen schooners at Shields. - On Saturday night a terrific gale broke on the north-east coast, accompanied by blinding showers of rain. The wine was exceedingly strong and gusty. About nine o'clock, a schooner from the North attempted to enter the Tyne for shelter. It proved to be the SEA HORSE, belonging to Aberdeen, which sailed from the Tyne on Saturday morning with coals for Aberdeen, and had been caught by the gale and compelled to put back. The SEA HORSE got between the piers, and was evidently in a fair way of securing a safe berth in the river, when, as she was coming up alongside the North Pier, a tremendous sea struck her on her quarter, and broke the rudder top, rendering the steering gear entirely useless. The master (Capt. Wilson) at once dropped his anchors, and for a time was held under the lea of the North Pier. Gust after gust of furious wind swept across the harbour; however, until, by the combined strength of the flowing sea and the wind, the SEA HORSE dragged her anchors, and drove towards the south side of the entrance to the harbour. The rocket apparatus was got out and put in readiness to be used; but the South Shields pilots had manned the Tyne lifeboat and were alongside the drifting vessel, which was then within a few yards of the north side of the pier, and some 400 yards from the shore. The crew, six in number, were all safely taken out of the stranded and wrecking vessel, and were landed at the Coble Landing, and well cared for."

SEAWARD PETREL was one of three motor fishing trawlers built for Seward Fishing Co.  The others were SEAWARD QUEST and SEAWARD VENTURE (SEAWARD VENTURE is registered in Lloyd's as being 12"" longer).  These three trawlers were early diesel ships built in the late fifties to replace the old coal burners.  SEAWARD PETREL fished the near water fishing grounds of the North Sea for seven days duration.
SEAWARD PETREL was sold in the 1970s to Brucewood of Aberdeen along with the two other ships where they were used for pair trawling which involved the stern canopy on top of the bulwarks and accommodation being burnt off to allow towing points to be fixed on top of the accommodation housing.  The two trawlers would use a bigger net that usual, fixed to the two trawlers.  SEAWARD PETREL AND SEAWARD QUEST were sold to George Craig & Sons of Aberdeen in 1981, who converted them for standby rescue duties.
In 1982 the vessels were renamed GRAMPIAN PETREL AND GRAMPIAN QUEST.  GRAMPIAN PETREL was sold in 1992 to unknown owners.  GRAMPIAN QUEST was still used by George Craig in 1994-1995.

The Indochina Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. has been formed, under management of Jardine, Matheson + Co., to acquire from the China Coast S. N. Co. + Yangtse Steamer Co. vessels listed to run steamers on coast + rivers of China and between China, the Straits settlements + Calcutta ... the new steamer Seewo will be taken over at valuation of £26,000. Built in Aberdeen, she was despatched to China in February 1881. She was specially built for the southern coast trade that has Hong Kong for its centre.

Royal Cornwall Gazette, 28/05/1886:
Seechon, Capt. Hankinson, was wrecked in March at north end of Taichow Islands (between Shanghai and Amoy + Swatow) bcause of heavy fogs which make navigation in Chhinese sease so difficult at certain seasons. When it became evident ship would be wrecked, Capt. Hankinson ran her as close to the shore as possible. Utmost order prevailed during efforts to save passengers + crew, but one boat with 7 occupants was swamped. 2 of ship's lifeboats landed on Shangta Island + were hospitably treated. The third boat landed on an island where they were at first believed to be pirates, but later treated kindly when they were accepted as shipwrecked crew. Several passing steamers missed their signals, but they were eventually picked up by the Swatow of the China Navigation Co."

Gross Tonnage: 342 ton",Dept Of Agriculture & Fisheries For Scotland,,,"Yard Number: 939
Official Number: 335164
Built by Hall Russell's for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Scotland.

Original cost £20,000.  Used by Dept. of Agriculture and Fisheries for dredging in smaller ports in North East Scotland, such as Portsoy, Buckie, Arbroath.

The contract to build the SHEARWATER was awarded to Hall Russell by the Scottish Government who also ordered the fishery research ship CLUPEA (940) together. SHEARWATER is a thin screw grab suction dredger. A Priestman crane with a buckey grab is situated on the bow which deposits the silt from the harbour into an open holdwell on the starboard side holdwell. A trailing suction pipe is stowed on deck when required for sandy shingle is lowered over the side. The forward end of the pipe is sleeved through a steel plate which slides into 2 guide rails that go down the ship side to a valve hole at the bilge bottom. Once the pipe is in place the valve is opened, the pumps are switched on and the gravel is sucked into the holdwell. When the holdwell is full the ship proceeds out to sea to dump its load by opening six hinged doors under the keel.

In 1978 deemed too expensive and sold to Grampian Regional Council (although listed in Lloyds as owned by UK Government) who continued dredging work. 

2003-2004 owners listed as Moray Council, still listed 2005-2006.

It was reported in the Evening Express (date unknown) that the vessel was being sold to new owners in Rosyth in 2013 for further use. A replacement dredger is proposed to replace SHEARWATER by the Scottish Government.

SHEARWATER is still in operation in 2016, after being sold by its previous owners Moray Council in 2012. It is now owned by Shearwater Dredging, Edinburgh. Moray has a new dredger that has replaced SHEARWATER. It was built by MacDurk shipyard and is called SHELKIA.

SHEARWATER was spotted on 23 Sept. 2016 by Neil Young in Peterhead dry dock undergoing repairs to the prop shafts. It was noticed that the original grab crank had been removed and a hydraulic J.C.B. crane in its place. Also the trailing suction gear has also been removed as it was never used at all as said from Chief Engineer. (Neil Young was at the building of the ship)."

Aberdeen Journal, 03/08/1859:
Loss of the SHEPHERDESS of Aberdeen.  It is with great regret that we announce the loss of the barque SHEPHERDESS, Captain Urquhart, from London 28th February, bound to Port Elizabeth, Algoa Bay, with a full cargo, which occurred on Saturday May 28th off Cape Receife Lighthouse.  August Weleke, Seaman, gave evidence to resident Magistrate:- ""I was at the helm when the ship struck.  The Captain had gone below to fetch the chart.  I had observed no breakers before she struck.  I felt her tremble, which knocked the helm out of my hand.  I put the helm up, but she would not answer it.  She slewed her stern round and then struck several times, very heavily.  Some of the masts gave way.  I heard the Captain call out ""Lower the Boat"", then a sea came and washed him overboard.  He was holding onto the main brace.  His son tried to hold him, then a second sea came out, but could not.  Eventually the jolly boat was got out.   We called to them to take us off, but they could not reach us.  I left the wreck on two planks.  I saw three of my shipmates follow me on planks, but they drove more to sea.  I saw a schooner and waved my hat.  It bore up to me and rescued me.  Before we struck we had no man heaving the lead.  The Captain said he would round Cape Receifeas close as he could"".
Most melancholy to state, 12 of the crew of 14 met a watery grave, of whom eight belong to Aberdeen.  Captain Urquhart leaves a widow and five of a family and his son, who was 2nd Mate, is among those who perished.   Robert Caithness, the First Mate, a young man, belonged to Aberdeen. As did John Cargill, Carpenter (a young man, son of Captain Cargill), John Thomson, Steward (who was married) and A. Smith, T. Wilson and R. Mackay, Apprentices.  The SHEPHERDESS was renewed just before this fatal voyage.  She was only partly insured."

SHOREHAM was built for Stephenson Clarke to mainly carry coal to power stations.  She was built by Hall Russell's, being hte fourth of five similar ships buil for the company by other yards in Britain.  the other ships were GOSPORT, HAYLING and AMBERLY.  

SHOREHAM is known as a Mid Island Class vessel which means that cargo ships built in this era had machinery, gallery and crew quarters at the aft end of the ship, and the bridge, wheelhouse, captain and matess cabins were at the fore end of the ship. Two cargo holds lay between the aft accommodation and the bridge island and one hold in front of the bridge and forecastle. It was said that this style of vessel was preferred by Captains: being further forward they could see over the bows better.  Now all cargo ships have everything accommodated at the aft end.

SHOREHAM was lengthened in 1969 by 20' amidships cargo hold walls.

The Examiner, 16/11/1834:
[Quoted Aberdeen Herald] We regret to statethe loss of the fine brig SIR WILLIAM WALLACE, Anderson, of this place, bound for Stornoway and Aberdeen from Quebec, near Island of Lewis in a most tremendous storm. After undergoing incredible hardships, with a terrible sea making a complete and almost incessant breach over the vessel for 2 days, so as to destroy the provisions, crew were so completely exhausted with exertion and privation, that they were in greatest danger of perishing as, on their perilious situation being discovered in the morning, no assistance could be afforded from the shore. Crew were, however, saved.

In the Admiralty Court, London, action was raised by the Dutch ship HELEN AND ANNE against the ship SIR WILLIAM WALLACE of Aberdeen, which on her homeward voyage from Sydney, and while off the Lizard, on 4th December last, came into collision with the Dutch vessel, causing considerable damage.  Court of opinion SIR WILLIAM WALLACE was solely to blame.

Lloyd's Qeekly Newspaper, 26/05/1878:
Ship SIR WILLIAM WALLACE, 968 tons, Capt. Colville, sailed from Gravesend on 18th inst. bound for Townsville, Queensland, and had on board following emigrants - 39 married men, 38 married women, 133 single men, 52 single women, 58 children between ages of 12 and 1 and 9 infants, making total of 328 souls. The single women are under the charge of Miss Macallister, Dr. Ryan acting as surgeon superintendent.

Hull Packet and East Riding Times, 24/10/1879:
Intelligence received from Lloyds states that Aberdeen clipper ship SIR WILLIAM WALLACE, which left Adelaide, South Australia, on 5 May last with cargo of wool and other produce for London was spoken on 25 September by vessel which has just arrived Swansea.  75 guineas per cent were paid in beginning of week to effect reinsurances on her at Lloyd's Underwriters thinking some serious accident had happened to the vessel.  She is 172 days at sea and reports having had a very bad passage round Cape Horn.

Rockhampton (Queensland) Morning Bulletin, 15/03/1880:
Health of immigrants having been checked, they were brought ashore by steam tug FITZROY, with a punt in tow to carry their luggage. SIR WILLIAM WALLACE left London 26 Nov. and Plymouth Dec. 4. Fresh N.W. wind for 24 hours, then NE for several days. Got SE trades in Latitude 21-20N [off NW Africa] with fine weather and light winds. Crossed equator 2 Jan., Gough's Island 19 Jan. and Meridian of the Cape 26 Jan. Moderate winds to Tasmania 29 Feb. and Sydney Heads 3 March and anchored off Rockhampton 12 March.  Only accident 3 March when young man James Reynolds fell overboard. Lifeboat was lowered in 3 minutes, Chief Officer Mr Gray in charge. He could not swim and failed to catch a lifebuoy thrown to him. After 8 or 10 mins he was picked up insensible, but after an hour recovered. He was exceedingly fortunate and appears to have been kept afloat by air getting into 2 large pockets of his coat. Captain Colvin reports there is large cargo aboard, which will be partly unloaded Rockhampton and remainder at Townsville. He speaks well of general conduct of passengers and Dr. Hickling (completing his 7th voyage to colonies as surgeon) reports they were generally healthy during voyage with no deaths and 1 birth (a boy named William Wallace). Doctor reports 15 cases of measles and 2 of enteric fever. Passengers speak highly of good treatment received from Captain, Officers, crew, Doctor and Matron Miss Cairncross (who cared for female immigrants). The young women are of good character, considerable no. having been used to dairying work and some domestic service. Men have principally been agricultural labourers and a few stonemasons, carpenters, etc. They appear well adapted for work and of the right stamp.

Rockhampton Morning Bulletin, 18/02/1882:
Captain Gray reports that a few days after leaving Rockhampton weather became very bad, increasing to a hurricane. This continued for 3 days and several sails were blown away. After that weather abated somewhat, but ship was now leaking. Pumps were kept going and after about a week ship became unmanageable. Crew wished to leave the ship, but Capt. Gray persuaded them to stand by her, one man through a heavy lurch of the vessel fell overboard. Boat was immediately lowered, but could not rescue the man, A. B. Happle from London. Crew of boat were hoisted back aboard, but because of weather boat could only be towed astern and ultimately broke away and was lost. A few days later crew refused duty for 2 hours, but they were again pesuaded to man the pumps and pumped the vessel out. Ultimately the SIR WILLIAM WALLACE was brought to anchor in Kepple Bay.

Sydney Morning Herald, 16/07/1889:
Case against Chief Officer of SIR WILLIAM WALLACE, David Longhill of Sydney, was preferred by the Master, Capt. Brown and heard in the Hong Kong Marine Court. Captain said on 10 May while at sea he gave Longhill orders to cast the lead very 2 hours, but he said he had better be given the orders in writing. He walked alongside Capt. on the poop and pushed over the starboard rail and later made a rush at him with his shoulder, hustled him against the rail and seized him by the throat. Court found that, although the manner of the defendent towards the master appeared to have been most disrespectful, they did not consider there was enough evidence to prove misconduct, court directed that he be discharged from the ship, but his certificate would not be dealt with.

South Australian Register, 06/02/1890:
The colonial barque SIR WILLIAM WALLACE, which left Sydney for Shanghai 27 Jan, with cargo of coal (1,400 tons) returned to port this afternoon in a crippled condition. During recent heavy weather mainmast and all gear above it were carried away.

Newcastle Morning Herald, 20/05/1891:
Trial continued in case brought by James Cole Ellis against South British Fire & Marine Insurance Co. to recover £1000, the amount of an insurance policy on ship SIR WILLIAM WALLACE. Vessel was insured before she left for Shanghai. After she got back to Sydney for repairs owner subsequently decided to apply for the insurance instead of going to expense of repairs, which he claimed would have been greater than value of the ship. After insurance co. disputed claim vessel had been sold for £332. Insurance co.'s claim was that vessel was unseaworthy at beginning of voyage, but jury found against them on this point and decided there was evidence of a constructive total loss. Case continued on grounds (supported by Chief Justice) that jury had not returned a reasonable verdict. Chief Justice argued jury must have disregarded evidence of logbook, which showed vessel encountered no heavy weather and yet within 2 or 3 days at sea had to put back to port and must therefore have been unseaworthy when she put to sea. New trial ordered.

The Aberdeen Lime Company was established in 1837, with company vessels generally carrying coal, lime and manure. Sailing vessels, such as Smithfield, also transported granite setts to London. These, covered with heather and wood chips, provided a floor for cattle also being shipped to London markets.

The vessel was built in 1842 at the Duthie shipyard for the Aberdeen Lime Company. This schooner sailed in the coasting trade from Aberdeen until its wreck in 1878.

1862: Master - Archibald; Owner/Agent: Aberdeen Lime Company.

Dundee Courier, 24/10/1873:
Schooner SMITHFIELD, belonging to Aberdeen Lime Co., arrived Aberdeen yesterday with cargo of coals from Sunderland. Captain reports vessel had been in collision with a steamer on night of 21 Oct. when off Blyth. Steamer struck SMITHFIELD with considerable force amidships on starboard side, carrying away her main gangway and damaging portion of bulwarks. One of SMITHFIELD'S crew jumped on board the steamer and was taken away. Night being dark and strong westerly wind blowing, name of steamer could not be seen, but is supposed she is the ALICE, of Grangemouth.

Dundee Cuorier, 15/03/1875:
Aberdeen - schooner SMITHFIELD was seen on Saturday morning to be on fire. Vessel had been leaking a good deal and water had found its way into hold full of lime, creating fire, which it will be difficult to quench. Deck is being covered with sand to try to put out fire.

Newcastle Courant, 06/12/1878:
Board of Trade enquiry at Aberdeen into cause of loss of schooner SMITHFIELD on Harborough Sands on 28 Oct. - court found through gross carelessness of Captain, in addition, Mate was not qualified to be second in command, having no certificate and being unfamiliar with the chart.

ABERDEEN JOURNAL, 27 NOVEMBER 1883:
'Voyage of an Aberdeen Emigrant Ship to Sydney'
'The ship SMYRNA arrived on Saturday September 29th from Plymouth with 412 emigrants on board on board for this colony. Captain Jamieson, her commander, has brought her out in first class trim and unlike many of the emigrant ships which have come out here, she is exceptionally clean and tidy and an inspection of the vessel at once shows that great attention has been paid to the matter of keeping her in order from truck to keel. The good health that the emigrants have experienced throughout the voyage is, therefore, easily accounted for, and when, out of 412 emigrants, there occurred only 1 death and that being a child from general debility, it will be at once imagined that much comfort and attention has been shown toward them. The deceased name was Sophia Clegg and her age 2 years. The emigrants are classified as follows: - married couples, 52; single men, 110; single women, 83; children 94 - consisting of 51 girls under 12 and 43 boys under the same age; and 15 infants.
After passing Cape Leeuwin, the barometer showed indications of a gale and on the 19th September whilst Philip Nunn, an apprentice on board, was engaged stowing sail on the mizzen topgallant yard he fell overboard. A boat was at once and, in a futile effort to save Nunn, 2 men - named J. Glass, boatswain, and A. Norbey, A.B., were drowned. There was a heavy sea on at the time, and the boat was only lowered amid much swell. The unfortunate disaster created much regret amongst the emigrants, all who witnessed it testifying to the fact that the two men showed unlimited courage on the occasion. There were 3 births on board. The surgeon was Mr. J. Perkins and the Matron Miss Drew, in whose praise the emigrants speak highly. One of the men drowned, Alexander Norbey, is, we believe, an Aberdonian, and the boy Nunn is the son of a clergyman in the North of England - this was his second voyage. Many of the emigrants on board the SMYRNA belonged to Aberdeenshire and the North. The SMYRNA is owned by George Thompson, Jnr., & Company of Aberdeen'.

The Leith registered steam tug 'PET' took the 'SNOWDROP' in tow, but as they reached the narrows the increasing violence of the wind caused the tug to set the schooner adrift at 5pm, not only in an attempt to save the sailing vessel, but because the 'PET' was running short of fuel.  The schooner when went to anchor and was soon in distress, but sea conditions prevented any assistance beng rendered.  The schooner's lights were last seen at about 7pm, when it is supposed she foundered with all hands due to the stress of the weather.

Launched November 1866

Described as one of the finest sailing ships ever built, not only one of the fastest but by far the largest ship to be composite built (of iron frames and teak planking).  SOBRAON was a very popular passenger ship because of her speed and comfort.  

Many crew stayed with the vessel for her entire seagoing career, 1866 to 1891, and her equally popular second Captain, J. A. Emslie, served on her for 24 years from 1867 to 1891.  The crew consisted of captain, 4 officers, 8 apprentices, carpenter, sailmaker, boatswain, engineer, 2 boatswain's mates, 26 able-bodied seamen, 4 ordinary seamen, 2 boys, 16 stewards and 2 stewardesses - 69 crew in total.

Built for Shaw, Lowther, Maxton & Co. who also owned the famous tea clippers ARIEL and TITANIA she was in fact loaded as a Devitt & Moore ship and they eventually bought her in 1870.  SOBRAON traded between London and Sydney (her route between 1866 - 1871) then later Melbourne (route from 1872 - 1891), carrying ninety first class and forty second class passengers, plus crew and sailing once a year leaving in September for the best of the weather. 

Her fastest trip to Sydney was 73 days, to Melbourne in 68 days, always returning via the Cape of Good Hope instead of the Horn.  She usually stopped at Cape Town on her return voyage and at St Helena, a break which was popular with passengers.

Her popularity as a passenger ship is proven by the clientele which chose to travel on her; Lord & Lady Belmore on their way to assume the Governorship of New South Wales and Mr Ducane, the Govenor of Tasmania all sailed on her.  The Duke of Edinburgh had her made the flagship at the Sydney Regatta and was entertained onboard.

She was sold to the New South Wales Government in December 1891 as a reformatory ship and lay at anchor in Sydney harbour for the next twenty years.  In 1911 she became a training ship for boys run by the federal government.

Commissioned as HMAS TINGIRA on 25th April 1912.  Decommissioned 30th June 1927.  Laid up at Kerosene Bay, Sydney and eventually broken up in 1941.

See Basil Lubbock's book 'The Colonial Clippers' for further details on this vessel's heyday.

Scrapped Sydney, 1936.

From article by George H. Johnston, 21/3/1936, Australian Newspapers Online:

""Alexander Hall's greatest creation was undoubtedly the Sobraon, of 2,131 tons, her house flag at the main truck floated nearly 200 feet above the water and under full sail she spread more than 2 acres of canvas. She was decked and planked with almost imperishable teak from forests of Burma. When it is recalled that Sobraon was originally designed as a steamer, it is curious to note than she became one of the fastest and most seaworthy of the clippers.

On each voyage 3 bullocks, 3 cows, 90 sheep, 50 pigs and 300 geese and fowls were carried to provide fresh food for passengers. Out of consideration for the passengers, Sobraon was never ""pushed"". Had Capt. Emslie decided to ""crack on"" canvas as the other wool clipper captains did, the records of the Cutty Sark, Thermopylae and Lightning would have fallen before the deeds of the Sobraon. She often ran 2,000 nautical miles in a week and speeds of 16 knots were not uncommon to her. Once she travelled equivalent of 392 land miles in a day. She was once off Cape Otway light when only 60 days out from London, but calms and head winds then spoilt what would have been the fastest voyage ever made by a sailing ship between England and Australia,

It is a testimony to her strength that she suffered little damage in her career. She encountered one severe storm when running her easting down in 1889, passengers were battened below for 3 days. Bulwarks, lifeboats, deck fittings, galley and a deckhouse were washed away. A terrific wave smashed the galley salloon skylight and tons of water poured below, washing the terrified passengers from their feet. 

On 2 occasions Sobraon was almost put ashore in English Channel in heavy fogs. Twice she caught fire, but flames were quelled before any great damage was done. In her service from 1866 to 1891, only one person was lost overboard, and that was ascribed to suicide.

Now in Sydney Harbour, the shipbreakers' hammers are battering in her staunch old planks.""

Sydney Morning Herald, 21/12/1888:
Ship SOPHOCLES cleared customs here for London with full cargo, including 4649 bales wool. Ship had lengthy stay in port, not because of scarcity of cargo, but in hope of freight rates rising (if anything got weaker). Whole of her miscellaneous cargo has been put into her in 10 days.

Drowned in Sydney Harbour, N.S.W. whilst boating on 24 Nov. last, William Henry Riley of ship SOPHOCLES, from Gosport, aged 16 years.

Sydney Morning Herald, 17/9/1889:
90 days passage for an Aberdeen White Star liner from London to Sydney is in excess of usual time, but is explained by calms and light winds on Western side of Cape of Good Hope, and remarkable run of fearful gales on this side. SOPHOCLES left London 11 June, crossed Equator 17 July and Cape of Good Hope 11 August. In 40 degrees East began 17 days of some of worst weather ship's officers have met with in a lengthy experience. Furious hail and snow squalls came down continuously and ship was running under reefed topsails and foresail. Gigantic seas broke over ship, threatening as if to bury her completely. Decks were constantly being filled up to the rails and cabins were smashed. One fearful sea broke in the sides of 2 of the boats, carried away pooprail and broke all ports forward. On 26 August, 2 of crew lashed to wheel for safety, were thrown over wheel and sustained serious cuts to face and limbs from which they have only recently resumed duty. Captain Smith is taking a holiday at home and ship is under command of Captain Robert Murray, one of oldest master in White Star Line. SOPHOCLES is to load wool for January sales.

Hobart Mercury, 6/3/1890:
Ten guineas percent premium has been paid in London as re-insurance of SOPHOCLES, overdue from Sydney 26 Oct.

Adelaide Chronicle, 8/4/1905: 
Sydney, 4 April: Italian owned barque SOPHOCLES, which signalled yesterday from Cape Otway for assistance, arrived Hobson's Bay in tow this afternoon. Captain reported she left Adelaide 25 March for Falmouth with 13,262 bags of wheat and was about 100 miles off land when strong SW wind brought up such a sea that foremast went at the cap and practically wrecked all aloft. One of able seamen said ""our trouble came on 30 March. In the early hours the barque struggled along under close canvas in a stiff SSW wind. The seas began to get up quickly and vessel rolled tremendously. Suddenly at 3:30am, there was a crash aloft and the foremast parted at the head and foreyard snapped. As other rigging fell in the darkness and smashed away the sides we thought we were going, but set to work to cut away the wreckage. At daylight we saw that foretopmast and top gallant mast were missing. Main top gallant mast had snapped off and was beating against the deck, one boat had disappeared and deckhouse was wrecked. We sighted Cape Otway. The tug eagle came up and her services were accepted. Shipping experts consider it one of the worst cases of dismasting in their experience, but none of hands was injured.

Details from Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, who own the shipbuilder's model of this vessel:

The SS SOUTH BULLI was commissioned for ownership and use by the Bellambi Coal Co Ltd in New South Wales in 1913. 

The Bellambi Coal Co Ltd can be traced back to 1857 when Mr Thomas Hale opened a mine at Bellambi. Mr Hale constructed a jetty at Bellambi from which to ship the coal and by 1858 he owned two cutters, two schooners and a barque. In 1862, the mine became insolvent and for the next 26 years lay undeveloped until the Bellambi Coal Co Ltd was constituted in 1888. 

In 1901, the Directors of this newly established company decided to purchase the adjoining South Bulli Colliery and developed its own fleet, proving integral to the economic growth of the Wollongong region. 

Not long after SS SOUTH BULLI was launched for use by the Bellambi Coal Co Ltd, the vessel was taken over by Jones Bros Coal Ltd and re-named SS ABERSEA. On 5th May 1934 ABERSEA collided with the collier TYALGUM, which was on its way to the Tweed. TYALGUM had its side badly stoved in when ABERSEA, which was bound from Newcastle to Sydney deeply laden with coal, could not see TYALGUM'S lights. The accident occurred at 5.15am off Norah Head. ABERSEA'S stem was also sprung, with the plating folded across it. Fortunately, the resulting leak was soon fixed.

On 21st May 1932 ABERSEA was reported to have been stranded on a reef at Bellambi Point when from Sydney to Wollongong and on January 9, 1949 when being towed through the Glebe Island Bridge by the tug Emu, the latter struck the bridge after a heavy gust of wind , causing it to sink. It was later raised by the Titan crane, but the damage was beyond economical repair. 

ABERSEA was withdrawn in June 1960 and in July sold for demolition in Blackwattle Bay. She was replaced in service by KOORINE.

The vessel was classified ice strengthened to withstand the Arctic waters where she fished.  The fish caught was frozen aboard the ship in deep freeze units in blocks and stored in the fish hold.  SOUTHELLA was fishing up to 1981 when she was converted from a fishing vessel to a standby safety vessel until 1986 for company not known.  She was owned in 1981 by Marr, renamed SEISELLA and working as survey vessel.

Aberdeen Press & Journal, Friday 11th April 1975:
'Spartan Tide had to wait for tide...' by Jim Kinnaird
'The Aberdeen-built rig-supply and towing vessel Spartan Tide found herself a little sparse on tide yesterday.
So much so that her launching from the Footdee yard of Hall, Russell & Co. Ltd., was delayed by 25 minutes until the flood tide gained sufficient height for the attempt.
Time and tide, it's said, wait for no man - but yesterday man had to wait for the tide.  Contrary winds can sometimes upset tidal predictions to quite a degree - and this is apparently what happened yesterday.
In the event it mattered little for no ceremony was arranged to mark the launching of the 191ft Spartan Tide, the second of two ships built by Hall Russell for Tidewater Marine Inc., of New Orleans, under a £2,000,000 contract.
It is the owner's custom instead to arrange a commissioning ceremony when their ships are ready for service.
Spartan Tide is a sister ship to the Trojan Tide, named at the handing over ceremony last month by Mrs John Wright, wife of the chairman and managing director of the shipbuilding company.
Tideater Marine are the largest supply ship operators in the world and their Aberdeen-built vessels are designed for general supply, towage and anchor-handling duties.
The ships are each powered by twin 2875BHP diesel engines driving controllable propellers in Kort nozzles.
They have bow-thrust units to increase manoeuvrability and have a service speed of 13 knots.
Accommodation is arranged for up to 20 people.'

SPINNINGDALE was the start of the John Lewis built/developed pocket trawlers. SPINNINGDALE was built for J. Forbes, the skipper and Bruce Stores (part owner and agent).
SPINNINGDALE fished from the starboard side only as the port side was enclosed to provide more cabin space for crew.  
SPINNINGDALE was sold to Seaward Fishing (Aberdeen) in 1985. Lloyd's Register lists the vessel as being registered to Burriot Ltd, Aberdeen (a Spanish company) and owned by another Spanish Company, Burlort Ltd, managers Penfro Pache Ltd and registered to Fleetwood, Fishing No. FD29.
Sometime during 1985-90 SPINNINGDALE was altered to the Spanish fishing layout on their vessels.


1st February 2008, wrecked on St Kilda in heavy weather.  All crew rescued by RAF.

From the BBC news website, 1st February 2008:

""The Spanish crew of a trawler that was driven aground in gale force winds and high seas on the island of Hirta, St Kilda, have been winched to safety. 

The 14 crew had been unable to launch life rafts due to the poor conditions. All those on board were airlifted off by a Stornoway Coastguard helicopter. 

The trawler, the Spinningdale, ran aground on rocks by steep cliffs. 

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency's first female pilot, Liz Forsyth, was involved in the rescue, the MCA said. 

An archipelago, St Kilda is the most remote part of the British Isles, lying 44 miles west of Benbecula. 

Four of those who were aboard the vessel have been taken to hospital suffering from effects of the cold, while the others have received dry clothing and will be found accommodation. 

The Marine Accident Investigation Branch will launch an investigation into the incident. 

Lifeboat crews and coastguard teams were also alerted after the vessel ran aground. 

A second helicopter, the RAF Sea King Rescue 137, was scrambled and put on stand-by to assist in the rescue operation. 

Coastguards said removing the crewmen was not easy in the treacherous conditions. 

Helicopter crews had to wait until first light before attempting the rescue. 

They flew the boat's crew to Stornoway. 

CHC Helicopter Corporation - the company which provides Stornoway's search and rescue copter - said the incident was the new S92's biggest challenge to date. 

Ian McLuskie, search and rescue manager with CHC, said: ""The rescue was performed in extreme weather conditions at a very hazardous location.""

When Donaldson Rose purchased the ‘ST LAWRENCE’ in 1841 he was satisfying a demand from the emigrants wishing to buy fares to settle in Upper Canada. The vessel had seven feet between decks and was classified by Lloyd’s as A1 rating.

Between 1842 and 1855 she took 1,750 emigrants to Quebec. In April 1848 the ship was fined for having two passengers more than her list certified. In June 1855 there were 3 deaths on the crossing caused by the spread of disease.

Aberdeen Journal, 25/10/1848:
After steamer VELOCITY was wrecked entering Aberdeen Harbour and her wreck was floating in the channel, leading lights were turned off to prevent other vessels trying to enter at tide time. One vessel did come in, the brig ST. NICHOLAS, of Aberdeen, from Newcastle. It appears she made the bay in the evening and, despite seeing the lights out, the captain decided to run for the harbour.  There being no lights and the night very dark, the ship got close to the breakwater before her real position and danger were discovered. Finding it impossible to lay up to the channel, and being on a lee shore, the vessel was sheared off and took the ground at high water without damage. A cry was got up for the lifeboat, but in the judgement of experienced men, the crew were not considered to be in danger and, as the vessel had come ashore at the top of the tide, it was concluded that they might land in their own boat or walk ashore as the water fell. This was effected and crew got ashore safely at 3a.m. The ST. NICHOLAS is coal laden and is expected to be got off when her cargo is removed.

An entry in the Aberdeen Register of Shipping states that the registration of the St. Nicholas has been cancelled having been wrecked in Aberdeen Bay, 8th February 1859.

Renamed: TAHITI (2018)

As of June 2003, the vessel sails to Cape Town and St Helena from Portland, Dorset rather than Cardiff.  Vessel managed by Andrew Weir Shipping.  This was the last vessel built in Aberdeen.

St Helena is the last working Royal Mail Ship in continuous service.

The 128 berth passenger and cargo vessel will retire in July 2016, due to an island airport due to open in 2016.
The last sailings of the vessel will include a rare visit to the UK. Voyage 242 will see the vessel visit London, sailing under Tower Bridge and be moored alongside HMS BELFAST from 5th to 14th June.
She will be at anchor in St. James Bay  for five days in July before arriving in Cape Town on 15th July.  This was to be the end of her service but due to issues with the airport, RMS ""St Helena"" is expected to continue in service until September 2016.


""The RMS St Helena arrived in St Helena for the last time on January 29, 2018. As Britain’s last working postal ship, she sailed to the remote islands of St Helena delivering mail to 4,500 residents for nearly three decades.
St Helena now has a commercial airport, so the purpose-built ship is no longer needed. Renamed MNG Tahiti, the 103-meter (340-foot) ship is being readied by her new owner MNG Maritime to become a floating armory working in the Gulf of Oman. She will deliver security guards and weapons to vessels sailing through the region and is expected to be operational in her new role in the next few months"".

Wrecked near Capetown, 29 August 1880

Dundee Courier, 14/11/1876:
Barque STAR OF AFRICA, launched some weeks ago from Messrs Duthie's building yard, sailed on Saturday for Capetown with full cargo of coals.

York herald, 01/09/1880:
Capetown, 30 Aug. - British barque STAR OF AFRICA, from Calcutta for this port, struck on the Albatross Rock yesterday and became a total wreck. All on board except the second officer and one seaman were lost.

South Australian Register, 20/09/1880:
STAR OF AFRICA, owned by Messrs Anderson & Murison, has been totally wrecked on Albatross Rock, Captain Barron, his wife, the first mate and most of crew were drowned. The spot where she struck is about a mile from shore on a most desolate coast. Surf breaks very heavily and it would seem impossile for any boat to land in safety. Course had just been shaped, vessel was running at about 10 knots and anchors were being got ready to enter Table Bay when at about 4.30a.m. she struck. Sails were at once set to head for the shore, when she struck again aft and at once went down. There was no time to launch any boats. The second mate felt himself being drawn down into the vortex, when he clung to a hencoop and after some time managed to get to an upset boat, to which 4 or 5 others were holding on. They succeeded in righting her and with an oar which he found he managed with great difficulty (she being waterlogged) to scull her onshore. His fellow sufferers had died from exhaustion. Only other survivor was a Manilla man."

Lubbock, 'The Colonial Clippers':
Star of Peace was fastest of earlier White Star clippers and made 4 consecutive passages to Sydney of 77, 77, 79 and 79 days under the redoutable Captain Sproat. She was a very rakish looking craft. In 1873 Captain Boaden left Star of Peace to take Samuel Plimsoll. After being run for some years by Burns, Philp & Co. of Sydney she was converted into a Hulk at Thursday Island, being only broken up 1895.

Caledonian Mercury, 22/07/1856:
The new ship STAR OF PEACE, one of the regular Aberdeen clipper line sailing between London and Sydney, left Plymouth 31 January, crossed equator 19 February, rounded Cape of Good Hope 43 days out and was off Van Diemen's Land [Tasmania] 9 April, thence to Sydney she met with contrary gales or would no doubt have reached her destination within 75 days from London. The ship in build resembles the WALTER HOOD, but is superior in length and beam and her lines are much finer.

Daily News, 16/09/1857:
The 91,222 Australian Sovereigns ex the ship STAR OF PEACE from Sydney reached London this afternoon.

Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper, 29/10/1871:
Capt. Richard Boaden, Master of ship STAR OF PEACE from Melbourne, was charged with assaulting and falsely imprisoning James Evans, a seaman.  On Monday the sailor was charged with mutiny and assaulting the Captain and sentenced to one day's imprisonment.  Capt. Boaden was then charged that he had falsely imprisoned Evans and kept him in irons for 2 months and that in course of last 2 months he had for several days bread and water only.

Pall Mall Gazette, 22/11/1871:
At Central Criminal Court, London, Capt. Richard Boaden was charged with unlawfully assaulting a seaman named Evans.  After hearing the evidence, Deputy Recorder said it was not necessary to hear Counsel for defence.  It was to be regretted that the Captain had detained Evans for longer than was necessary, but Evans addressed the Captain in language which could not be tolerated. It was his opinion that the justification for so treating him was the tone of insolence and menace which the man habitually used to the Captain and the great peril in which the Captain and passengers were of mutiny from the sullen, morose disposition of Evans and his friendliness with the crew.  Jury returned verdict of not guilty.

Melbourne Argus, 25/06/1879:
The case of the barque STAR OF PEACE, the crew of which left her in a body, came before Wilmington Court yesteday when 9 men were charged with being absent without leave from the vessel. For the Master it was contended that a conditional sale did not constitute a change of ownership which relieved the seamen from the articles. For the men it was held that sale had been proved by following sale note produced by the Captain - ""Melbourne, 7 June 1879 - Captain Laird, Star of Peace - I have this day sold to Messrs Grice, Sumner & Co. by your order ship Star of Peace, 1114 tons register, as she now lies in Hobson's Bay, together with her tackle, provisions etc. for sum of £3,500, payable in London after production of transfer of title"". Magistrate considered that sale had to all intents taken place, thus relieving crew from articles and discharged the prisoners.

Sailed Thursday ship ""STAR OF TASMANIA"" for London.

Launceston [Tasmania] Examiner, 22/12/1860:
Ship ""STAR OF TASMANIA"" sails from Launceston this morning with full cargo of wool, etc. She is somewhat celebrated for having beaten clipper ship ""HEATHERBELL"", of Hobart, which will probaly sail about same time as the ""STAR"" [both for London].

Launceston Examiner, 24/09/1861:
""STAR OF TASMANIA"" sailed from Gravesend 27 June, encountered strong westerly gale for 3 days in Bay of Biscay, got NE trades in 20 North and lost them in 10 North, crossed the line 21 July, got SE trades in 2 South and lost them in 20 South. Passed Tristan Da Cunha 16 August and Cape 23 August. Sighted King's Island 18 Sept., thus making splendid run of 74 days land to land.

Launceston Examiner, 27/10/1861:
""STAR OF TASMANIA"" with nearly 200 passengers bound for New Zealand gold fields, 31 horses and cargo chiefly of colonial produce, left at noon Saturday. Large no of persons assembled on boat wharf and on banks of river and joined with passengers in three hearty cheers when she weighed anchor.  Decked with flags from stem to stern she glided downstream in tow of the ""TAMOR"" tug. Soon it was discovered that spontaneous combustion had taken place among blankets saturated in oil (for livestock). Some charcoal also ignited. Capt. Tulloch directed supply of water, brought by buckets into hold and extinguished fire. Besides water damage it is reported dozen packages were thrown overboard.

Launceston Examiner, 07/12/1861:
""STAR OF TASMANIA"" sailed yesterday with valuable cargo of colonial produce for Dunedin Gold Fields - 92 cart horses, 140 tons flour, 10 tons butter, 500 bushels wheat, 25 tons hay, large quantity of drays, carts etc. and drapery goods as well as 12 cabin and a few intermediate passengers.

North Otago Times, 07/02/1868:
On Monday last, 3rd Feb 1868, it came to blow heavily from the E.S.E., and the sea rising rapidly. There were at the time lying in the bay the ships Water Nymph, official number, 21,579, 584 tons register, (Captain Edwin Sinel Babot) and the Star of Tasmania (Captain Andrew Culbert), loading wool at this port for London, the former having 244 and the latter 2095 bales aboard. There were also two small craft, viz., the Otago, Captain Campbell and the Emu, Captain Morland. About noon the Blue Peter was hoisted at the flagstaff at the Esplanade, as a signal for the vessels to stand to sea. The Star was dragging, parted anchors and rapidly drove towards ashore. Came ashore about 7 p.m. broadside. The ship began to break up. Attempts were made to get a line ashore. A line from shore carried out by Duncan Young, in the employ of the Boating Company, reached the vessel.

'Fifteen minutes after the Ormesby Queen had slipped into the water of the River Dee, the Stephen Brown, a motor collier built for Messrs J. & A. Brown and Abermain Seaham Colliery Ltd, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, slid down the slips from the yard of Messrs Hall Russell & Co. Ltd. into Aberdeen's tidal harbour.
As the collier left the way she was named by Lady Home, wife of Sir David George Home.
The Stephen Brown is a single screw, single deck vessel of about 1800 tons deadweight, with raked stem, cruiser stern and machinery aft.  She is 253ft 6in. in overall length with a beam of 40ft.
There are two holds served by steel hatchways of the combined rolling and pivoting type.  The hatchways are free from obstruction to facilitate grab discharge.'

Aberdeen Journal, August 28th 1850:
'On Saturday, there was launched from the building-yard of Messrs Hall & Sons a fine ship of 600 tons OM and 527 tons NM.  She is considered to be the finest vessel both in design and workmanship, as yet turned out by her builders.  She has been built under contract for Capt John Robertson, formerly of the 'JOHN O' GAUNT' of Liverpool, and will class A1 for 13 years on Lloyd's Register.  The whole arrangements for the launch were so complete that the vessel seemed to glide into the water at the word of command, when she received the name of 'STORNOWAY'.  We are informed she is intended for the China trade, and will sail for London in a few days'.

Aberdeen Journal, December 10th 1851:
'The ""Stornoway,"" another clipper recently launched here, made the run home from Whampoa to London in 103 days, coming down the China Sea against the full strength of the south-west monsoon, and accomplishing the distance between the Cape of Good Hope and London in 37 days.  So far as this season's rivalry between British and American clippers in the China trade has been tested by their performances, the British builders have the best of it'.

STORNOWAY regularly sailed from 1850 to 1860 carrying tea for Jardine, Matheson & Co. of London.  In 1861 she was sold to Mackay & Co., London.

Wallaroo Times, September 30th 1865:
At Thames Police Court, Captain Thomas Tomlin, Master of ship STORNOWAY, and Mr. Matthew Read, Chief Mate, appeared to answer charge of violently assaulting and falsely imprisoning George Baker, an able seaman. Baker, who then possessed a Master's certificate, joined STORNOWAY in Sydney February last to work his way home in capacity of able seaman. On 12 May, after being at wheel for 2 hours, he claimed Mate Read began to abuse him and said he was no sailor but a soldier. He told Mate he was as good a man as himself. Mate struck him on the mouth and his lips bled profusely. Baker raised wooden relaying pin, but before he could use it, the Maten seized it, forced his head onto the rail, then threw him down on deck, punched him with great violence, and jumped on him. Captain came out of his cabin, said ""that will do, Mr. Read"", and ordered Mate to drag Baker aft. He was imprisoned for 7 days, 18 hours and for 2 days of that time was not allowed any food. He was kept in sail room, 3/4 full of damp sails and very hot. He was allowed only 2 hours of exercise per day, on release so ill he could not work for 10 days. Witnesses confirmed Baker's statements. Defendents committed for trial.

---------------------------

STORNOWAY raced another clipper, the CHRYSOLITE, also built by Halls.  Both ships left Whampoa, China on 9th July, 1852 loaded with tea.  They were neck and neck for 21 days with each other racing down the China Sea.  After 45 days still in sight of each other the CHRYSOLITE eased away, arriving in Liverpool 22nd Oct, 104 days out, whilst STORNOWAY arrived 3 days later.  The STORNOWAY and CHRYSOLITE were the two fastest British ships at this time on the China tea run.

During her lifetime the STORNOWAY was commanded by various Masters:

1850-53: Capt. John Robertson
1853-62: Capt. H. L. Hart
1863-64: Capt. Watson
1865-68: Capt. Tomlins
1869-72: Capt. J. Waugh
1872-73: Capt. G. Greener

In 1867 she was sold to Welch & Co., Newcastle, and in 1871 was again sold to R. Chapman, Newcastle.

In 1873 she was was now reduced to trips to the Mediterranean.

On the 7th June 1873 the STORNOWAY was wrecked on the Kentish Knock at the mouth of the Thames.

Aberdeen Journal, 28/04/1824:
Brig Stranger, Soller master, of Aberdeen, went ashore at Garron Point about one mile north of Stonehaven. She had missed stays in tacking about and, drifting upon the rocks, received such an injury as to fill immediately + in now sunk by the rock in such a depth of water that mainmast is scarcely visible at high tide. Topmast + some of the sails, yards and rigging have been saved.

On a fishing trip from Aberdeen in command of John Emmanuel Peck on 11/12 September 1907 she stranded on the Fless Rocks at the SE end of Fair Isle in thick fog and wine E-Force 1 and became a total loss.  There are different accounts of what happened afterwards -
One account says that her crew (of nine) stood by the wreck in the lifeboat until they sighted some Fair Isle men in their boats who guided them ashore.  Another account says that the islanders found her still afloat with no-one aboard - miles from Fair Isle - when the fog lifted.

STRATHCLOVA was one of the first Mk2 successful pocket trawlers built by John Lewis for Alexander Simpson & others of Aberdeen.

It appears STRATHCLOVA kept her name throughout her career (though unclear whether Mr Simpson had her fishing number changed to Buckie BCK261 while he was still the owner of someone else). However a Mr C. Scupham of Lowestoft bought the ship in 1985 and reverted the registration and number back to Aberdeen, fishing from Lowestoft for two years until 1987 for Pesca Fisheries Ltd, Milfordhaven (a Spanish fishing company). Pesca Fisheries Ltd owned the ship until date unknown, then later owned by Liners & trawlers Assoc. Falmouth? from 1996-2001.

STRATHCLOVA capsized at Marin, Spain on 18 February 2001 and was declared a total loss but was not scrapped until 2006.


Aberdeen Press & Journal, Tuesday 1 July 1975:
'Trawler in Danger in calm water...' by Alastair Beaton
'An Aberdeen trawler was in danger of sinking early today - in the calm waters of Aberdeen harbour.
For the May Day that a crewman sent out in the early hours came from a phone box at the city's Fish Market, where the vessel had berthed the previous day.
Aberdeen firemen were called in shortly after 1am today to pump out the fish-hold of the trawler, the Strathclova (A734), after a deckhand, Mr Robert Maver returned to collect some gear from the vessel and found she had a pronounced list and was lying very low in the water.
Robert (22), 3/5 Chapel Street, Keith, has been with the vessel since she was launched two years ago.  The Strathclova returned yesterday from an eight-day trip to the West Coast, and the nine-man crew went ashore later.  All the other crewmen - including Skipper, Alexander Simpson, 39 Gordon Street - come from Buckie.
She had in her flooded hold a catch of 420 boxes of white fish - worth upwards of £4000, pointed out Robert - to be landed at today's market.  But it is feared that most, if not all, the fish has been ruined.
With the trawler lying almost down to her scuppers - it is believed that the flooding was caused by a fault in her pumps - the vessel was in real danger of sinking before firemen arrived to pump her out.'"

""STRATHDON"", ship, from London for Sydney, 6 days out, 19 August, Lat. 42.36N, Long. 11.54W [off Cape Finisterre].

Melbourne Argus, 30/07/1867:
Sydney, Monday - southerly gale blowing with heavy showers.  Ship Strathdon was off the heads this morning from London.  A pilot attempted to board her but was capsized.  A second pilot tried to rescue him but also got capsized... the Government despatched the Vesta to the assistance of the Strathdon, which anchored close to the rocks at George's Head.  Vesta brought back survivors - pilots Fullerton and Shanks and 10 others.  Pilots Robertson and Reader, Robert Green (shipping clerk) and 5 of pilot's crew were drowned.  Fullerton's boat was dashed to pieces against the cliff.  A fearful sea is running.  The Strathdon was afterwards towed off a lee shore and anchored off Pinchgut.

Brisbane Courier, 24/08/1867:
(Editorial on inquest on pilot Reader). Pilot Robertson put to sea with crew of 4 men (smallest number allowed by Act). Notwithstanding tempestuous weather... no spare oar was put aboard or any inspection of her tackle.  The sail tore in two and men had to take to oars.  A sea struck the boat and carried away 2 oars out of 4.  Another wave struck and capsized her.  Robert Green, with his little butcher's boat, rescued the men, but had hardly done so when his own was rolled over and over about 20 times.  It is the genuine old British stuff such men are made of.  Not the slightest effort was made to render assistance by the ship Strathdon (although the 2nd Officer said the ship was short-handed and herself in great peril).  An experienced sailor eye witness said it would have been quite possible for a boat to have been put off by the Strathdon.

Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper, 14/07/1878:
At Thames Police Court Captain Batch of ship ""STRATHDON"", belonging to White Star Line plying between London and Australia, was accompanied by a young lady of about 18 or 19, who possessed considerable personal attractions. This young lady joined his vessel at Sydney, dressed in masculine attire, as an apprentice and represented herself to be a runaway apprentice from another vessel. The new hand did his duty as well as could be desired and became rather a favourite with the ship's company.  40 days out a communication to the Captain prompted him to tax the supposed apprentice with being of a different sex.  The would-be tar confessed that she was a lady, and now in female clothing, was placed in apartments more suitable than the forecastle.  Captain Batch asked to make a statutory declaration to put himself right with his owners, but Court had no doubt if he went to them and explained the affair it would be all right.  Messrs George Thompson & Co., the owners, have kindly undertaken to send their interesting ""middy"" home to her parents near Dublin. She had emigrated to Queensland about 14 months ago and had worked there as a barmaid and (in male clothes) as second steward of a steamer running short trips from Sydney."

Aberdeen Journal, 15 January 1897 (page 5):
'Aberdeen Trawler in the Storm; Exciting Experience...The Strathisla rode the storm splendidly, but at times the vessel was taken almost broadside on, and then the waves broke aboard.  All went well, however, until about ten o'clock on the evening in question, when an enormous wave, larger than any preceding, came over the starboard bow.  About five feet of the bulwarks were stove, the indentation giving one the idea that the trawler had collided with another steamer, so strong was the force of the breaker.  After damaging the bow the water rushed aft, dashing against the sides of the wheelhouse, smashing two of the windows, and carrying away two of the frames.  Horace Stroud, a deck hand, was on duty in the wheelhouse at the time, and the broken glass inflicted two severe wounds to his forehead and upper lip. The water rushed out without doing further damage.'

Aberdeen Journal, 08/03/1871:
STRATHNAVER, ship, from London for Sydney, 3rd. January, 10S + 31W [off coast of Brazil].

Sydney Morning Herald, 16/10/1875:
The missing ship STRATHNAVER - would it be too much to ask our worthy commodore to send one of his squadron to search the Auckland Islands. It is within the range of possibilities that the STRATHNAVER might have been cast ashore on these desolate islands (sailed Sydney for London 27 April). The boats may have been carried away and the crew deprived of all chance of reaching the mainland. It would be repugnant to every British heart to think that nothing had been done while there was even a chance of rescue (letter to Editor).

Sydney Evening News, 11/05/1876:
Colonial Treasuree, Sydney, yesterday transmitted following message to Colonial Treasurer of New Zealand - ship STRATHNAVER left Sydney in April last year and not since heard of. Idea prevails she may have been wrecked on Auckland Islands and suggestion made that Government should send exploring vessel to ascertain - to oblige by replying whether you know of any recent communication with these islands.

Sydney Evening News, 15/05/1876:
Telegram from Sir Julius Vogel, New Zealand, to Colonial Treasurer, Sydney - HMS NYMPH prpoceds to Auckland Islands, chiefly to make enquiry about STRATHNAVER. We have not heard from there for some time.

Aberdeen Journal, 26/07/1876:
Intelligence from New South Wales states that HMS NYMPHE has been ordered to visit the Auckland Islands to search for any persons who have survived from the Aberdeen ship STRATHNAVER, which sailed from Sydney last year and has not since been heard of."

Left Aberdeen on 9 February 1900 with a crew of nine and was never heard of again.

16 February 1900: Lost off Shetland Isles. Mainland Sumburgh, Hogg of the Ness, 59.51.20N 01.18.30W. Voyage Aberdeen - fishing and return.

In 1977 a piece of wreckage was discovered on the foreshore at Sumburgh which included a builder's name plate and year. During a severe storm on 16.02.1900 a trawler was observed from Sumburgh Head Lighthouse lying between Sumburgh Head and Horse Holm steaming to her anchors. At a later stage of the storm distress flares were observed in the area, but with no facilities available to attempt any sort of rescue, nothing could be done. Once conditions and visibility improved there was no sign of the trawler, and it is presumed she was overwhelmed by the storm, with the loss of all hands. 

The remains of the wreck, comprising spare anchor, chain, engine, valves, brass fittings etc can be indentified among the kelp growth on the boulder strewn seabed, close to the tip of Scat Ness in approx 14 metres of water.      http://shetlopedia.com/Strathtay

Steel trawler

19 March 1925 - Summary: vessel was returning to port in rough conditions when a wave lifted it onto the North Pier.  Crew rescued by life saving apparatus. 

After sailing on a fishing trip 12 March 1925, heavy seas persuaded the captain to return to Aberdeen where a number of other trawlers were stormbound.  The Strathyre crossed the harbour bar but in a very heavy swell, it being low water, a huge wave lifted onto the North Pier where she remained fast.  Captain Crombie, the Harbour Master, called out the Coastguard Life Saving Crew and after a line was attached to one of her masts, the crew were brought ashore by breeches buoy leaving the trawler to become a total wreck."

Launched 14th May 1957 by Mrs Sudbury, wife of Col. F. A. Sudbury, managing director of Silvertown Services Shipping Co. Ltd.

Press & Journal Account of launch, published 15th May 1957:
'The Ship That Ran Away. 
Crowds of onlookers saw the 660 ton, 370 foot long cargo vessel Sugar Producer break her drag hawsers when she was launched yesterday from the yard of Messers Hall Russell & Co., at Aberdeen and she sped unguided across the harbour. 

The runaway vessel narrowly missed the North of Scotland and Orkney and Shetland Shipping Company’s passenger and cargo ship St. Ninian lying on her berth.
Then she crashed against the concrete quay at Point Law coaling station, her rudder biting deep into the concrete. 

Helpless
Fortunately no ship was at the coaling berth. A trawler (the Dunkinty) had pulled out shortly before the Sugar Producer was due to leave the slips.
Rebounding from the Quay, the Sugar Producer’s bow struck the bridge of the St. Ninian causing slight damage.

Tugs had been standing by at the launching ready to take the new vessel in hand, but the crew were helpless to act. It was impossible to get a hawser aboard in time to prevent the ship striking the quay wall.
After the ship had been moved into her fitting-out berth the damaged rudder was inspected by shipyard workers. 

Built for Silvertown Services  Shipping Co. Ltd., London, the Sugar Producer was named by Mrs F. A. Sudbury, wife of the Managing Director.
She is the third vessel to constructed by Hall Russell and Company for the same owners.'

Aberdeen Press & Journal, Wednesday 4 September 1957:
'Sugar Ship Runs so Sweetly on her Trials'
The Sugar Prouducer, a cargo vessel with luxury accommodation, ran her ballast and endurance trials in Aberdeen Bay yesterday in ideal weather conditions.
Constructed for Silvertown Services Ltd.,bof London, for sugar carrying from the West Indies to this country, the vessel is a credit to her builders, Hall, Russell & Co. Ltd.

Of the popular cargo-ship type with engines and accommodation aft, the vessel is 350ft. in length with a beam of 53ft. and is capable of carrying about 6500 tons of cargo.

The most remarkable feature of the ship, however, is the accommodation.  Apart from the two storeboys, every member of the crew has a spacious cabin to himself, each being fitted out in handsome lines.

A suite of rooms for the supercargo is better than that to be obtined in many a first-class hotel.

There is a ship's office, a spacious and delightfully fitted-out lounge, and dining-room, and messrooms for the officers and crew.  Port holes have given way to big windows in the public rooms.
A spacious stairway in mahogany is another feature, while the large galley is a housewife's dream with its stainless steel sinksand many cooking aids.  There is also a hospital.

Among thos onboard for the trials were Mr John Wright, managing director of Hall, Russell & Co. Ltd; Mr S G Christensen, the owner's superintendent, and Captain J R Cassidy, who will be in command of the vessel.

The Sugar Producer is due to sail on Saturday to Rotterdam.'

Brig TARTAR, of and for Sunderland, Master Jacques, from London, was in collision during the night of 15 Nov. off Flamborough Head (Courant says with schooner BILLYBOY, which had both her masts carried away, Journal says with schooner MARY & SARAH, which almost immediately sank, crew picked up by another vessel).

Ipswich Journal, 27/01/1866:
On 18 Jan. brig TARTAR, Johnson, of and from Sunderland, for London with coals, missed stays and took the ground on the Barber Sand about 7p.m. and commenced making water. At 2a.m. next day a signal was made for assistance by burning a tar barrel and about half an hour after a boat's crew went off, but owing to the state of the sea they could not board until 6a.m. when £350 was asked to get the vessel off and into safety.  As no agreement could be made the salvors went to work and succeeded in floating her. On following morning she was taken in tow by Yarmouth tugs PILOT and SAILOR and brought into harbour, making a good deal of water."

TARTAR was built as a steam trawler by A. Hall & Co. in 1904. No info on owners. Then in Lloyd's 1910-11 edition the ship is now registered as a tug for Soc. Anon. De Remorq Hercule (C.

To change a ship from trawling to a tug would have been no easy task to undertake as there would involve a lot of alterations to the superstructure and all the rivets has to be cut out by hammer and chisel. No welding or burning in those days."

Lamport and Holt pioneered the frozen meat trade from the River Plate to the United Kingdom by entering into a contract, in 1886, to convey 230 tons monthly, and the S.S. THALES was specially fitted for this purpose in the following year.

THERMOPYLAE was one of a series of vessels built by Walter Hood for the Aberdeen White Star Line; unusually, she was designed by Bernard Weymouth, senior surveyor at Lloyds Register contemporaneously with his preparing the Society’s Recommendations for Composite Ships.

The THERMOPYLAE was one of the fastest clipper ships; she was designed for the China tea trade, and set speed records on her maiden voyage to Melbourne - 63 days, still the fastest trip under sail. The CUTTY SARK was built the following year to compete with THERMOPYLAE in bringing back the new season's tea from China. In 1872 she raced the clipper CUTTY SARK from Shanghai back to London and won by seven days after CUTTY SARK lost her rudder. Her record day's run was 380 statute miles, a feat exceeded by no sailing ship before. From 1879, with steam displacing sail from the China tea trade, she to Sydney as her Australian terminal and entered the Australian wool trade homewards, with but one final tea run in 1881.

Aberdeen Herald, 22 August 1868:
'LAUNCH - There was launched, on Wednesday, from the shipbuilding-yard of Messrs. Walter Hood & Co. a composite ship of 1300 tons, owned by Messrs. George Thompson & Co., and commanded by Captain Edward, late of the Ethiopian.  The ship, which was christened ""The Thermopylae"" by Mrs Hardy Robinson of Denmore, has been throughout constructed after the most approved principles, built of the most durable materials, and classed in the highest range of character at Lloyds.  She is intended for the London and China trade.'

All of George Thompson's Aberdeen White Star Line vessels were noted for their handsome appearance; green hull, gilded scroll work and white masts, yards and bowsprit.  The THERMOPYLAE had a white and gold figurehead of the Greek hero Leonidas, the King of Sparta.  

During her early career THERMOPYLAE was presented with a statue of a golden cockerel, which was placed atop her main trunk, only to be stolen one night and discovered the next day at the top of her rival, the TAIPING's main mast and restored to its rightful owner.

Despite the newspaper articles of the launch stating her master as Captain Edward, who captained her from Aberdeen to London; in the event of her maiden voyage from London to Melbourne, George Thompson favoured Captain Robert Kemball.  Kemball had made a name for himself on the Hall-built clipper YANGTZE in the 1867 tea race and proved to be a popular and highly successful captain.

On her maiden voyage, THERMOPYLAE sailed to Melbourne in just 60 days, pilot to pilot, via Shanghai and Foochow, breaking records on each leg of the journey - only steamers had previously matched such speeds.  
The Aberdeen Journal commented; "" 'Thermopylae', Kemball, arrived Melbourne 9th January from London 61days.  Sailed thence 22nd, arrived Newcastle N.S.W., 30th January.""

The Melbourne Argus reported the arrival of THERMOPYLAE thus:
13 January 1869, page 6, 
'The splendid and almost unprecedentedly rapid passage made by the new clipper ship Thermopylae, from London to this port, has created more than ordinary interest in nautical and commercial circles...It seemed almost impossible, and certainly never entered into the calculations of the most sanguine, that a voyage to the antipodes could be accomplished by a sailing-ship in fifty-nine days, the period taken by the Thermopylae to within sight of the Australian coast...She is in every respect a fine specimen of naval architecture, a model of symmetry and beauty; her sweeping lines and exquisite proportions, her graceful outline and general compactness, conveying an idea of perfection.'


1868-74 Master Robert Kemball - route London to Australia / China / London
1874-81 Master Charles Matheson
1881-84 Master John Henderson
1884-88 Master Nathaniel Allan
1888-90 Master Jenkins

Basil Lubbock's book 'The China Clippers' (1914, James Brown & Sons, Glasgow) mentions an encounter with HMS CHARYBDIS as the two ships passed Port Phillip Heads:

'Both vessels crowded sail on the same course, but as soon as THERMOPYLAE had her canvas set she began to draw rapidly away from the warship, in spite of all the latter's efforts to stay with her.  At last, when the THERMOPYLAE had conclusively proved her superiority, the captain of the CHARYBDIS could not restrain his admiration, and hoisted the following signal in the Mercantile Code as he rapidly dropped astern: ""Good bye.  You are too much for us.  You are the finest model of a ship I ever saw.  It does my heart good to look at you."" '

Despite her fame as a tea clipper, THERMOPYLAE more often sailed to Australia in the wool trade.  

In 1890, after more than two decades as a China tea clipper and then an Australian wool clipper, THERMOPYLAE was sold by her Aberdeen owners to a Canadian company Thomas Reford.  She was put on the rice and timber carrying trade between South East Asia and Vancouver.  Despite shortened masts and being cut down to a barque rig in July 1893 and her crew reduced from 35 to 20 men, she continued to make speedy passages.  On one occasion she crossed the Pacific in 29 days, a world record at that time, and on another kept level for three days with the Canadian Pacific steam liner EMPRESS OF INDIA, which was capable of 16 knots.

In 1895 she was sold to the Portuguese Navy as a training ship and renamed PEDRO NUNES, after a 16th century Portuguese mathematician and geographer.  The vessel was found to be in too decrepit a state for the intended conversion, and she was reduced to a coal hulk. 13th October 1907, her useful life expired, she was towed out to the mouth of the River Tagus as part of naval regatta presided over by the Queen of Portugal, and sunk by two Whitehead torpedoes fired by torpedo boats.

In June 2003 a group of professional Portuguese divers found the remains of THERMOPYLAE about 30 metres down on the seabed off Lisbon. The hull is mainly buried beneath the sand but enough is visible to identify her as THERMOPYLAE.

London, 6 Feb. - arrived THERMOPYLAE from Sydney 19 Nov.

Sydney Morning Herald, 27/12/1884:
London, 24 Dec. - arrived from Sydney, THERMOPYLAE, sailed 8 Oct.

Sydney Morning Herald, 02/05/1913:
The famous old clipper ship THERMOPYLAE has at last been destroyed. Till recently she was used by the Portuguese as a training ship on the River Tagus, but being too old for further service it was decided to do away with her. As the old vessel had such a fine reputation in days gone by, it was decided not to sell her, but to give her a naval funeral. She was towed out to sea by 2 Portuguese Men O'War and sunk.

The following is from the book ""Clippers for the Record"" by Marny Matheson, 1984.

With Charles Matheson's promotion, Captain John Henderson took over THERMOPYLAE and sailed her for three voyages from March 1881 to January 1884. He captained her on her last visit to Foochow in 1881, returning in one hundred and seven days. The next two years saw him following Charles' previous route via Sydney, returning with wool round Cape Horn.

Under Allan THERMOPYLAE'S routines changed. In 1885 she sailed for Melbourne, arriving there on 8th April. Two weeks later she set out to visit Lyttleton, the port of Christchurch N.Z., with coal from the bustling Newcastle. She returned to Sydney by 16th August with a typical New Zealand cargo of produce.

THERMOPYLAE,1891,STEAMER,"Hall, Russell & Company, Limited",,98566,,100939,"length 350 5/6' x breadth 44 1/12' x depth 33 1/12'
Gross Tonnage: 3711ton","G Thompson & Co., Aberdeen",,,"Yard Number: 264

She was said to be the largest vessel ever built at the yard at that time at a cost of £70,000.

Thermopylae was the second ship of that name to be built for George Thompson's Aberdeen Line and intended for the emigrant trade to Australia carrying passengers as well as cargo. 

The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported the new ship on 31st October 1891:

'Once more there is included in the Aberdeen Line fleet a vessel bearing the classic name Thermopylae.  The new vessel, however, differs widely from her renowned namesake, and the contrast marks clearly the great strides made in marine architecture since the launch of the old ship in 1868.  The new Thermopylae, which is a splendid screw steamer of 4000 tons gross register, was launched on Saturday, September 19, at Aberdeen, having been built by Messrs. Hall Russell & Co.  She is said to be the largest vessel built at that place...when fully laden she will carry a deadweight of about 5000 tons.  The engines, which are of the triple-expansion type, are capable of deveopling 3000 horse-power, and when fuly equipped this addition to the Aberdeen-Australian liners will be one of the finest passenger boats afloat.   The total cost of the Thermopylae will be about £70,000.  As is already known in Sydney, the master of the new steamer has been given to Captain Alexander Simpson, who made himself so popular as master of the Australasian and other vessels of the same employ.'

The SS THERMOPYLAE presented a yacht-like appearance, being a three-masted clipper bowed steamer, she carried yards on the foremast and often used sail.

Homeward bound from Australia she was shipwrecked on a reef in thick fog at Green Point at the western entrance to Table Bay, Cape Town, South Africa on the 11th September 1899.  Two racehorses 'Chesney' and 'Kiera' although injured, were saved as were all the passengers and crew.  The ship also carried a valuable cargo including nearly 8,000 copper ingots, 5,000 bars of bullion and ten boxes of gold valued at £50,000.

Built for the Aberdeen White Star Line she would not have been fully insured as the owners would have taken the risk of loss themselves.  Having cost upwards of £80,000 to build, the owners George Thompson & Co. would have been lucky to recoup a quarter of this from insurers.

Transcript from the Court of Enquiry:

JUDGMENT of a Court of Enquiry, held on the 18th day of September, 1899, before WILLIAM MARTIN FLEISCHER, Esq., Resident Magistrate for the District of the Cape; Captain JOHN TYSON, of the R.M.S. ""MOOR,"" and Captain THOMAS CARTER FEARON, of the barque ""GENERAL ROBERTS,"" into the circumstances attending the wreck of the screw steamship ""THERMOPYLAE,"" of Aberdeen, official number 98,566, in Table Bay, on September 11th, 1899, under authority of the Attorney General's letter, No. 5/1001, dated September 16th, 1899. 

It appears, from the evidence given before this Court, that the ""Thermopylae"" sailed from Sydney, New South Wales, on the 11th August, 1899, bound for London, via Melbourne, Albany, Port Natal, and Table Bay, with general cargo, and a crew of 84 hands all told, as well as 52 passengers, and was well found and equipped and fully manned. 

All went well until 11th September, 1899. At 7.46 p.m., 11th September, Cape Point Light was abeam, bearing N. 25Â° East, distant four miles, the master alleging that he kept this course till 8 o'clock p.m., when it was altered to North 37Â° West, the speed being 12 knots. 

At 10 o'clock p.m. the Robben Island Light was sighted, and the course was altered so as to keep the light ahead. 

At 10.20 o'clock p.m. the Green Point Light was sighted, and the master says he altered the course to East by North by compass or North 46Â° East true. This course, the master was of opinion, should have cleared the vessel of all outlying dangers between Green Point by two miles, and the Whale Rock by a similar distance. 

After proceeding on this course for some time the red light on Mouille Point showed up, and appeared to the master to open up in perfect accord with his observations on previous voyages, in which he had, when approaching Table Bay by night, steered an exactly similar course. He says he was throughout continuing a most careful examination of all the lights, and that a thorough scrutiny of his surroundings did not in any way lead him to even the remotest suspicion that the vessel was in any danger whatever. While carefully scanning the outlook through his night glasses for the Green Pier Head Light, the master says he became conscious of a sudden change in the appearance of the Mouille Point Light it loomed towards him with extraordinary proximity but the Green Point Light which appeared almost abeam did not show any observable change in distance. As a precautionary measure, however, he immediately ordered the quartermaster to starboard the helm, and continuing his observations through the glasses thought he perceived an undulating roll extending shorewards from the bow. Without a moment's loss of time he called out ""Hard-a-starboard,"" but almost simultaneously, and, in fact, before she could answer her helm, the ""Thermopylae"" struck heavily and remained stationary, and is now a total wreck on the rocks within a quarter of a mile of the Green Point Lighthouse. The speed of the vessel at the time being about 10 knots. 

The Court is satisfied that everything possible was done by the master, officers, and engineers after the disaster to save life and property, and no lives were lost. 

The Bridge Book, in which the course steered was entered, and the chart from Table Bay to L'Agulhas, by which the ship was being navigated, were not produced, it being alleged that they were lost on the night of the wreck, and the Court therefore has no evidence later than 7.46 o'clock p.m., as to the course steered when Cape Point was abeam, this being the last entry in the Deck Log, which was produced to the Court, to verify the master's statement. 

After a careful consideration of the evidence, the Court finds that at 10.20 o'clock p.m., 11th September, 1899, when the Green Point Light was sighted, and the course altered to East by North, no measures were taken by the master to ascertain or verify the position of the vessel, which could have been readily and accurately done by cross bearings of Robben Island and Green Point Lights, and a course set to take the ship safely into Table Bay, nor did he at any time use the lead to ascertain his position, or distance off the land. The weather was hazy over the land, but the lights were distinctly visible. The master, instead of taking these ordinary and necessary steps, relied upon his own judgment as to his distance from Green Point. 

We are of opinion that the vessel was not navigated with proper and seamanlike care by the master after 10.20 o'clock p.m., and that the master should have taken cross bearings or used the lead. 

We, therefore, find that the loss of the steam vessel ""Thermopylae,"" was due to the wrongful act or default of the master, William Philip, junior, and we do adjudge that the certificate of the said master be suspended for a period of six months. 

W. M. FLEISCHER, R.M., Cape.

On her maidenvoyage Aberdee - Royal Albert Dock, London, Thermopylae maintained speed of 14 knots as far as Flamborough Head, severe galethen tested her sea going capabilities, with most satisfactory results. For 5 hours she was obliged to anchor because of force of hurricane. She is fitted with most modern improvements in hull + machinery, including electric lighting, has most sumptuous accommodation for up to 50 saloon passengers + ample space in her tweendecks for large no. of 3rd class passengers.

Aberdeen Journal, 07/04/1841:
'...made first voyage from this port to Peterhead, where the owners and their friends are to have a splendid entertainment on board.  She is to sail from Peterhead for Greenock, where, we understand, she will take on passengers and goods for Port Philip & New Zealand.'

The Australian, 29/06/1841 (quoting Aberdeen Herald):
Report of launch - this splendid vessel... received her name from the Captain's Lady (Capt. J. Brown)... largest British oak vessel that has been built at this port. In terms of stability and symmetry a more admirable example of naval architecture is seldom to be seen. The cabins are fitted out in the most superb style. The saloon is lit by ports, is 7 feet high and has a library and a splendid mirror and is finished in style equal at least to any of the first class steamers. Cabins for 22 1st class passengers range off the saloon and are elegant and commodious, with side ports. There is a shower bath off the lobby. 2nd class cabins for 61 passengers are under poop and each has a side port. The steerage, also 7 feet high, is on a level with 2nd class and is to be fitted out for 140 passengers. Altogether cabins are most commodious and elegant of any ship from Aberdeen. THOMAS ARBUTHNOT will sail from Glasgow for New Zealand and Port Philip [Victoria]. She will afterwards be employed in the New South Wales and East India trade.

The Australian [Sydney], 15/05/1847:

Freeman's Journal, 08/08/1850:
Report received at Colonial Office of safe arrival at Sydney 3 Feb. of ship THOMAS ARBUTHNOT, in which 7 emigrant girls from north Dublin Poor Law Union.

I had great difficulty getting away from Sydney although I promised my crew double wages, some 6 or 7 left me as soon as the affair became known. I placed 2 armed policemen, night and day, one at each end of the ship. Still those that could swim got off somehow. I had to pay £5 and £5 per month for sailors to ship.

Daily Tribune, Brazil 2012, translation:
Found wreck for more than 100 years in Alagoas (name of a State of Brazil) 
The sailboat 60 feet and three masts Thyatira left London to Rio

The TV reporter José Francisco plunges into a fantastic adventure. He will try to locate the coast of Alagoas, a ship that sank over 100 years.

In the open sea, on the coast of Alagoas, hundreds of boats are used in shrimp fisheries. They take trawls that often get trapped in the rocks. Divers descended to release one of the networks found that it was stuck to the hardware of a ship very old and of unknown origin. We formed an expedition with nine divers to unravel the mystery of this wreck. The commander Djalma, with 50 years experience at sea, searching the ship, with the help of machines.

Water conditions in terms of visibility, are not ideal, because the location, despite being ten miles from the coast, still suffers the influence of the flow of the São Francisco River. The water is greenish. The wreck is about 30 feet deep. (Indeed is 30 meters deep) 

In the first images of the unknown ship, it is completely covered by the crust navy, by nets and ropes lost by fishermen. These networks can be a trap for divers. When you pull the network, the water gets even murkier, with a lot of dirt suspended, accumulated for over a century.

In this walk through darkness, we find two Goliath groupers. They have ugly face, but they are harmless and are threatened with extinction.

On the outside, there is a wooden door that is used to open the fishing nets, attached to a brass pin.

The diver Vagner Fernando who was discovered when the ship went down to remove the fisherman's net, but now felt the value of the discovery. ""Now it showed me that he is old,"" says Lonnie.

""At our area, on the northeast coast, we had invasions. The ship is very old for sure. It has more than a hundred years, ""says naval architect Francisco Glegiston.

We returned to the sea to visit the stern, the back of the wreck. A piece of crockery with names and a symbol is found, plus a ceramic that we can not identify. A mast party gives us the notion of a sailing vessel. Found no motor. The mystery continues.

Divers decide by hoisting out a loose, to try to reveal the history of the ship. Removing the crust with a hammer, came embossed symbol as the wind rose and the name: ""Thyatira"".

From the name, the mystery was unravelled. The sailboat 60 feet and three masts Thyatira left London to Rio de Janeiro on July 16, 1896, and disappeared in the sea, on the coast of Alagoas.

By the account of survivors, there was a fire on board, the crew could not handle. In charge, there were 800 packages of dynamite. The commander realized the danger and told them to cast the lifeboats overboard and all the crew survived. The Thyatira was split in half by the explosion, in the darkness of the night, and sank.

Built by A. Hall &Co., Aberdeen in 1885 and owned at the time of her loss by A. Milesi fu P., Genoa, was an Italian 3-masted iron fully rigged ship of 1,526 tons.
On 27 August 1916, TORRIDON (Capt. Antonio Massone), on a voyage from Baltimore to Genoa with a cargo of coal, was sunk by the German submarine U-34 (Claus Rücker), 30 miles southeast from Ibiza. There were no casualties, the crew was picked up by the steamer S.S. CATERINA ACCAME, sailing nearby. 
Note: TORRIDON had one sistership YALLAROI, renamed  SANTA CATERINA, broken up in 1923, after a fire that made her a complete loss in 1921, Genova.

Launceston Examiner, 13/05/1893:
LOCH TORRIDON, arrived London 3 April from Melbourne, reports that on Jan. 17 in 52.50S, 48W [between S. Georgia and Falklands, in Southern Ocean] she sighted two large icebergs to eastward, on 19th she passed between numerous immense bergs, ranging in size from 1/4 mile to 3 miles in length and from 500ft. to 1000ft. high. At 3.30 on same date Captain saw an immense continent of ice ahead, with apparently no open water. Passed to the east of this mass for about 50 miles, from aloft, as far as the eye could see, nothing but ice was visible. We threaded our way through numerous large bergs. Besides vast quantities of detached pieces of ice and small bergs.

Sydney Morning Herald, 07/09/1896:
In perfect order ship TORRIDON, a notable trader between London and this port, put in an appearance with a general cargo. She is annually loaded here with wool for London. Capt. Mearns reports having left Gravesend 3 June and was towed to Beachy Head with light west winds. Thence to Startlight [Devon] SW winds and landed pilot 9 June. Took light variable winds to the NE trades (picked up at Madeira 15 June and were lost 22 June). Variable winds then to 27 June, when S winds picked up and SE trades on the equator 1 July in Long. 24W [between NW Africa and Brazil]. SE trades proved light and unsatisfactory and were lost 19 July. Variable winds followed to Tristan 2 Aug. No steady winds experienced during rest of passage - distance of 200 miles in 24 hours was only obtained on 11 days during whole voyage.

Launceston Examiner, 23/05/1898:
LOCH TORRIDON left Greenock 3 Feb, when she made a smart run to the equator (1 March) and to Meridian of the Cape (24 March). While running the easting on 42S sensational events were met. 5 April in westerlies terrible squalls, which increased in violence during night. At 7.0a.m. on 6 April in 42S 72E [SW of Ascension Island], John Bell, an able seaman aged about 60 of Glasgow, was suddenly missed after a heavy sea had broken aboard - he had been engaged in clearing running gear on deck. Even if he had been seen in the water, nothing could have been done to rescue him in the gale then raging. An hour later 2 towering volumes of water thundered on deck, burying the ship to the rail. She staggered, stopped and all hands felt she was lost, but in a few moments she seemed to catch a fresh breath of life as she lifted and once more scudded before the hurricane - the 3 large boats were flattened. The apprentices' deck house had burst like a balloon and the donkey house had been gutted.

Sydney Evening News, 30/05/1903 and Adelaide Chronicle 06/06/1903:
LOCH TORRIDON, Capt. Mearns, lay a long time off the London berth at Sydney, but freights are not now so plentiful for sailing vessels. She left Port Pirie [South Australia] 14 May with cargo of ore for Antwerp. Heavy southerly gale struck on 24 May when south of Tasmania. Sea after sea tumbled aboard. Iron bulwarks went like so much paper. Several of the watch were swept off their feet by the seas and one seaman (H. Johnson) was picked up near the cabin entrance in a bad way (fractured collarbone) having been carried right aft by the sea. On 25 May, weather worse than ever, the ship broached to. Waves were taking charge of ship and threatening to send her to the bottom. Eventually we got her off before the wind. Subsequently in mountainous seas vessel again became unmanageable. Captain and two members of crew, while bricing the fore topgallant yard, were washed over the side, but fortunately seiged hold of fore stays. Vessel was towed into Sydney 31 May.

'Tug Supply Vessel Named in Aberdeen'
'Scene at Aberdeen shipyard of Hall, Russell and Co. Ltd., yesterday when the yard's new graving dock was brought specially into use for the naming of the new tug-supply vessel Trojan Tide.
It will be two weeks before the dock is fully operational, but the new facility provided a good inspection point for guests at the ceremony.
This was carried out by Mrs John Wright, whose husband is chairman and managing director of the shipbuilding company.
The Trojan Tide, built for Tidewater Marine Inc., New Orleans, was handed over to Tidewater's managing director, Mr Fritz Culver.
The ship was not named at her launching since it is the owner's practice to defer ceremony until their ships are commissioned.
Trojan Tide will enter service immediately with her first charter to J. Ray McDermott (UK) Ltd.
A second vessel for the same owners is being built at Footdee.'

A court of enquiry has been held at the Office of the Resident Magistrate, Port Natal, regarding stranding of ship TUGELA, Capt. George R. Stuart Master at Port Natal 3 Feb. Court, after hearing evidence of the crew, found that stranding was due to parting of the chain not being discovered till it was too late to save the ship: that no sufficient and vigilant watch was kept to guard against such a catastrophe. That the Captain must be exonerated from blame - that the Chief Mate, Edward Knowles, in charge of the ship, appears to have done all in his power after the accident was discovered: and that no special blame can be imputed to him - that there was no reasonable probability of the ship being got off through the surf after she was stranded with the appliances at command at this port.

Burntisland Shipbuilding Group Journal, Vol. 25, No. 1, October 1956, page 23-24:

""Tusker"" a single screw geared diesel tug for Ritch & Smith Ltd., Port Adelaide, Australia, was launched on 11th April 1956, from the shipyard of Alexander Hall & Co. Ltd.  The vessel has been designed for salvage, coastal and harbour towing duties at Port Adelaide... As the ship left the 'ways the naming ceremony was carried out by Miss Xenia Barr Smith, daughter of Mr T E Barr Smith, a director of the Adelaide Steamship Company Ltd.'

'The bronze propeller has been specially designed for use with a Kort nozzle which will enable the vessel to exert a direct pull of over 24 tons.'

'The windlass forward and the large winch aft are both electrically operated.  The steering gear situated on the deck aft is of electric hydraulic type.'

'Accommodation is provided for 20 persons and is lined with plastic material in pastel shades.  The wheelhouse, which is constructed of aluminium, is also lined of plastic material.  A large refrigerated compartment is fitted for food storage.  Mechanical ventilation is fitted throughout the vessel, including the machinery spaces, in addition to a system of natural ventilation.'

'Electric light and power is provided by two 60kw. diesel generators.  A standby generator of 10kw. is also fitted, and emergency lighting is provided by batteries.'

'The propelling machinery consists of British Polar twin diesel engines each of 800b.h.p. driving a single propeller shaft through twin hydraulic couplings and reverse reduction gear box which will give the vessel a service speed of 12.5 knots.  Both engines are controlled direct from the bridge.  Extensive use has been made of sound absorbing insulation in way of the engine room to eliminate noise.'

'Sufficient oil fuel and fresh water is carried to enable the vessel to remain at sea for 20 days at full power.  The entire machinery is being installed by the engineering department of Alexander Hall & Co. Ltd.'

Further details courtesy of Stewart Ross, Tasmania: 

After a career of some twenty two years, Tusker was sold to Mc Asphaldt Industries in 1980 for barge towing work, in Canadian waters, with no name change.
 
I can recall the ""Tusker"" coming from South Australia to Beauty Point, in northern Tasmania, to tow the ""George H. Evans"" from there to Port Headland in Western Australia.
 
She was then sold to Lowebod of Lagos, Nigeria in 2001, and renamed BODE, not long afterwards she was wrecked in local waters.

Newspaper article from The Press & Journal, dated 1957, talks about how many of the crew were Britons emigrating, though no Aberdonians ""among them""; ""the ship's agent, Mr James W. Pirie, Marischal Street, told a reporter [...] yesterday: 'I had quite a few applications here, but the recruitment was done by the owner's office in London'"". Roughly half of the crew were from Scotland and England, to stay in Australia, and the rest were Australians.

Photograph attached to the newspaper article is of the tug at the pontoon dock at Aberdeen, being prepared for her trials.

Barque UMGENI, stranded near Glenelg [South Australia], though happily no life has been endangered and it is hoped that both ship and cargo will be saved without much damage. In evening lights of a ship were seen by some fishermen in rather dangerous proximity to the beach, but was supposed to be a coaster whose skipper well knew his own road and weather was not such as to cause alarm. However, morning showed a barque to be ashore off Gray's Point, about 2 miles to north of Glenelg, where a bar has been raised by tide and currents. Vessel was UMGENI, Scorgie Master, 366 tons, coal laden from Newcastle and bound for Adelaide. Capt. Scorgie says he made out the light at Glenelg distinctly, but grounded about midnight. Little doubt that vessel went stem on to the beach and rising squalls gradually put her stern round until she lay almost broadside on to the sea, which at times broken over her.

VENDAVAL AND GALERNA:

For a brief period two Aberdeen built ships achieved international prominence as symbols of the conflicting loyalties of the war in Spain.  Trawlers 692 and 693 were named GALERNA and VENDAVAL.  Built to identical specifications they were big vessels, much larger and more powerful than the fishing boats usually built by Hall, Russell & Co.  Typically boats fishing out of Aberdeen would be 115 to 120 feet long; GALERNA and VENDAVAL were 215 feet from stem to stern. In keeping with overall length were their fish holds of nearly 30,000 cubic feet.  Set aft of the superstructure were twin boilers, heated by six furnaces, these powered a triple expansion steam engine.  On deck was a twin drum heavy duty winch capable of carrying 1200 fathoms of hawser on each drum.  Unlike most of the Aberdeen trawling fleet these vessels were equipped with wireless and equally modern for a fishing boat were the electric lights found below decks and on deck (for shooting or hauling nets in darkness); far better and safer than the ""bubbly"" oil lamps then often found on trawlers.  But modern as they were with new technologies they did have one structural thing in common with the smallest of Aberdeen trawlers, accommodation for ordinary seamen was in the foc'sle, above and adjacent to stores, at the stem where the ship punched through high seas, a place with few concessions to comforts.

GALERNA and VENDAVAL cost £32000 each. GALERNA's and VENDAVAL's fishing grounds were to be the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.

GALERNA and VENDAVAL were owned by Basque company Pesquerias y Secaderos de Bacalao de Espana (PSYBE, Salt Cod Fishermen and Driers of Spain). Ordered as identical vessels in May 1927 GALERNA was launched in November of the same year, VENDAVAL followed close behind taking to the water in December.  

For centuries Spain had fished the Grand Banks off Newfoundland seeking out the once prolific cod. And so it was in 1928 that these not so humble Aberdeen built trawlers entered a trade with a long history.  At the time the question of foreign boats trawling the fishing stocks off Newfoundland and Canadian waters was a contentious issue.  Vessels like GALERNA and VENDAVAL added to the problem.  From day one of the steam trawling industry builders and owners had looked for ways of increasing the catching power of vessels keeping pace with or outdistancing competitors. GALERNA and VENDAVAL were part of this process. Their powerful engines and winches gave them the ability to take many more fish than the traditional Newfoundland fleet, in other words play a not insignificant role in overfishing fragile waters. Regardless of this an even more immediately catastrophic situation was to overtake not only the fishing industry but the globe: PSYBE had placed their order for advanced boats just two years before the stock market crash and the onset of the Great Depression.  Not a moment for large-scale investment in trawlers.  But the company survived and in 1936 both vessels were in home ports in the north of Spain.

On 17 July 1936 Francisco Franco led a coup against the Republican Government. The Spanish Civil War had begun.  

Franco's intention was to take control of the whole of Spain including the Basque country. So the Basques prepared for war. Bilbao was the centre of resistance. On the south east corner of the Bay of Biscay the city's port channelled the region's imports and exports and it was in the waters of the Bay that trawlers GALERNA and VENDAVAL made their mark in the bloody conflict.

From the earliest days anti-Franco forces looked to total mobilisation of the regional defences. Central to this was utilising fishing fleets. Almost every vessel was seen as potential for the newly formed Basque Auxiliary Navy and the two Aberdeen boats were high on the list for requisitioning. Their power and size made them an ideal complement to the few genuine naval ships under Basque control.

In late 1936 GALERNA and VENDAVAL were commandeered, the former for the Basque Auxiliary Navy. She was fitted with 101mm and 57mm guns. Sadly GALERNA was to have a less gallant role when in October 1936 the trawler was boarded and seized by pro-Franco seamen and like her sister ship was armed and made ready for battle.  GALERNA became auxiliary support in the Nationalist navy destined to work with the cruiser ALMIRANTE CERVERA.

After fitting out as an armed trawler VENDAVAL took up escort duties in the Bay of Biscay: her role was to help keep the seaway open to ships entering and leaving the port.  Manned with over forty of a crew through November and early December the armed vessel guided cargo ships to the safety of harbour.  On 15 December the fishing boat was renamed NABARRA and it was in this guise that she achieved worldwide fame becoming a symbol of absolute defiance to the brutalities of Spanish (and by extension all European) fascism.  Before 1936 was out NABARRA was involved in a confrontation with a German merchant ship PALOS. Accompanied by another armed trawler, BIZKAYA, the Aberdeen boat arrested PALOS and forced her to berth in Bilbao. Hitler's Nazi German unsurprisingly had thrown its weight behind Franco and any German vessel approaching Spain was suspected of carrying arms or other war materials to the nationalists and hence was open to search and arrest. But Hitler was a big player in a dangerous game and when the German cruiser KONIGSBERG appeared off Bilbao on the 28th December it became obvious that Franco's Nazi supporter was not going to sit by and have his nation's ships seized. With little choice the Basques released PALOS.

Into 1937 and the war at sea intensified. Franco was attacking Bilbao from the land and sought to starve out the Basques. To this end mines were laid in the Bay of Biscay with the hope that this would not only inflict damage on the Basque Navy but also and probably more importantly deter foreign ships from trading with the Basques. On the 7th-8th of January NABARRA took up the challenge and chased off Nationalist ships VELASCO and GENOVEVA FIERRO which were laying mines just off Bilbao. Although Franco's mine laying operations were largely unsuccessful eight days after NABARRO forced VELASCO from the area the minelayer returned put down a field which caught a Basque patrol boat and minesweeper; both were sunk and 23 men died.

As the conflict deepened so NABARRA and her sister ships were called to increasing action coming to a head on the 5th of March 1937.  Four armed republican trawlers were escorting merchant ship GALDAMES to Bilbao when about Cape Matxitxako they encountered Franco's cruiser CANARIES which was then in the process of arresting the British registered YORKBROOK. A battle to free YORKBROOK ensued. CANARIES turned her guns on armed trawler GIPUZKOA. On fire and with five men dead GIPUZKOA made for Portugalete, east of Santander. Meanwhile shore batteries opened fire on CANARIES forcing her to momentarily withdraw. But respite was short for the Basque naval forces. Sighting GLADAMES and her escort the rebel cruiser returned to the fight. In a face to face battle the armed trawlers stood little chance against the cruiser, it was faster and more heavily armed than the fishing vessels.

Trawler BIZKAYA ran with YORKBROOK eventually finding refuge at Bermeo east of Bilbao. This left the lightly armed DONOSTIA and NABARRA protecting GALDAMES. DONOSTIA succeeded in breaking towards the French coast.  NABARRA was alone. Her master Enrique Moreno did all he could, he was resolute in defiance of the cruiser. But against a ship carrying 203mm turret mounted guns NABARRA had no chance. The skilled men in Aberdeen had done everything they could to make a seaworthy vessel; it was a good fishing boat but carried no armour plating. The riveted hull had withstood the storms of the North Atlantic. Steaming in dangerous seas, shooting, trawling and hauling nets this was what VENDAVAL-NABARRA was designed for not fending off a cruiser's shells. First to die was the Bos'n; then came a direct hit on her boilers which killed most of the engineers and stokers and ended any slight chance the ship had of escaping. Captain Moreno gave his men the opportunity to abandon ship, however, knowing that this would mean being taken prisoner by CANARIES he along with his next in command Ambrosio Sarasola chose to stay with the sinking vessel.

Out of a crew of forty nine only twenty men survived. They were taken prisoner, tried by Franco's court and sentenced to death. Fortunately their bravery in defying the might of CANARIES was recognised, the commander of the cruiser recommended that they be spared which Franco allowed: an act of humanity which stands in stark contrast to the brutality typical of the dictator's rule. 

And what of sister ship GALERNA? While NABARRA was being pounded to submission and loss GALERNA was earning a less than glorious reputation. History's hand was also upon ship 692: captured and manned by pro-Franco seamen the trawler was doing it all it could to harry and forestall any help being sent to the Basques. She was in the Bay of Biscay attempting to stop arms, raw materials and food getting to beleaguered Bilbao. Supporting the cruiser ALMIRANTE CERVERA the armed GALERNA patrolled waters outside the three mile limit and beyond the reach of republican shore batteries and in this role the ship achieved international notoriety, indeed, she became involved in a series of incidents which brought the Royal Navy close to breaking the British Government's stance of so-called non-intervention in Spain.

On the 6th of April 1937 Franco decreed that he was to enforce a blockade on the city of Bilbao. Up until then his navy had sporadically tried to stop all mercantile traffic to the port but with little success. By formally declaring a blockade he hoped to exploit the apparently supine action of European governments and scare off all traders. GALERNA and ALMIRANTE CERVERA were key players in this strategy.  The British response was to declare that all waters beyond the three mile limit were high seas and therefore in principle Franco should not interfere with lawful merchant vessels. However, there was some comfort in this for Franco as the British Government's main concern was to avoid confrontation. Ignoring intelligence coming from the Royal Navy and consulate personnel that there was no serious risk from mines in the Bay of Biscay the Government warned ships to avoid the area. The merchant marine paid no heed; operators saw the opportunity for good business and continued to trade. In a political rather than a naval display of force the Government dispatched Royal Navy ships to the Bay with the intention of advising British ships to avoid Spanish waters.

Events overtook the Government's cautious appeasement when the British registered THORPEHALL steamed to Bilbao.  Ten miles from the Basque coastline GALENRA sighted the ""blockade runner"" and fired on the unarmed merchant vessel.  GALERNA's master intended to do all he could to prevent much needed supplies reaching the Basques. THORPEHALL sent a message to the destroyer HMS BRAZEN which arriving on the scene ordered the armed trawler to pull away. All looked under control when ALMIRANTE CERVERA steamed to the scene and the Royal Naval ship now found itself outgunned.  However, irrespective of this BRAZEN's commander decided to face-down the Nationalists and he put his ship on actions stations whereupon GALERNA made for ALMIRANTE and the two took up position between THORPEHALL and the coast in an attempt to stop it entering Basque territorial waters. Royal Naval destroyers BLANCHE and BEAGLE were then called to assist the seriously threatened BRAZEN. Within an hour it looked like this stand-off was about to escalate into a much more serious incident when the German pocket battleship ADMIRAL GRAF SPEE came upon the scene, however, she adopted a conciliatory stance and advised the Spanish vessels to pull off.  THORPEHALL was instructed to enter Bilbao but Franco's navy was not done and had one final attempt at enforcing the blockade yet again with no success: The three destroyers placed themselves between the cruiser and the Aberdeen trawler and thanks to the intervention of the Royal Navy THORPEHALL made port safely.  British opposition MPs contrasted the resolute action of the Royal Navy with the ""turning tail"" stance of the Government saying it had hauled down the down the White Ensign and ""hauled up the white flag"".

On the 13th of April, a week after the stand-off, ALMIRANTE CERVERA's commander sent the message that henceforward any British ships found within Spanish territorial waters would be seized or sunk and that the territorial limit was to be extended from three to six miles (taking the cruiser beyond the reach of shore batteries). HM Government's response was to reject the new limit, stating that outside of three miles Franco had no right to interfere with lawful trade (it was acceptable within the old limit) but Prime Minister Baldwin hoped the Red Ensign would not be found in these troubled waters telling any captain seeking to run the blockade ""it is impossible to protect them [merchant ships] who go into that area so long as conditions prevail"", nonetheless the Royal Navy would continue to patrol the Bay of Biscay.

GALERNA and ALMIRANTE CERVERA continued, largely unsuccessfully, with the blockade. Faced with merchant ships continuing to run the blockade Franco told the British Government that all such attempts ""would be resisted by insurgent warships by all possible means"". This had little impact on the trade: between the 1st and 20th of April 1937 thirty two ships docked at Bilbao.  

On the 23rd of April the Nationalist navy confronted three British vessels - MACGREGOR, HAMSTERLEY and STANBROOK - running to Bilbao and yet again Franco's forces had to contend with superior naval force this time rather than three destroyers it was battle cruiser HMS HOOD supported by destroyers FIREDRAKE and FORTUNE. HOOD was fast and carried massive 15"" guns; she had been designed in the aftermath of WW1 and was mean to ensure the continued global superiority of the Royal Navy.   So when the Spanish cruiser and the armed trawler intercepted the three vessels they found themselves confronted by massive fire-power.  Undeterred GALERNA went after the merchant steamer MACGREGOR, ordering her to stop.  This brought FIREDRAKE into action who trained her guns on the trawler.  GALERNA then found herself under attack from shore batteries and her master decided caution was needed and he pulled away to the North West.  ALMIRANTE CERVERA took up the battle and turner her guns on the merchant ships at which point HMS HOOD confronted the cruiser, not surprisingly the Nationalist ship backed off.  And so the British ships entered Bilbao as one observer put it they arrived ""to enormous crowds [who] cheered as the procession of three red dusters passed slowly up river"".  This was the 23rd of April.  Three days later much of the joy felt by the Basques was lost when the German Condor Legion bombed the town of Guernica.

On the 19th of June Franco's forces entered Bilbao. The long nightmare of his dictatorship was about to begin.  Between her encounter with HMS HOOD and the fall of the Basque Government GALERNA had continued the unholy fight indeed, the day before Bilbao fell she had engaged with the republican armed trawler GIPUZKOA which had survived the Battle of Matxitxako. Along with other vessel GIPUZKOA had sought refuge in Santona, near Santander; she was hit and her men abandoned ship, one seaman drowned. This was more or less the end of the Basque Auxiliary Navy.  GALERNA was retained as part of the Nationalist forces until 1939 and the final defeat of the Republic when she returned to her normal duties as a fishing boat.

Lost due to fire in engine room 1st May 1974.  23 crew had to abandon the vessel and were rescued by a Hull freezer trawler, Kurd.

Reported in Fishing News International, November 1974:
 
'Victory is lying on her starboard side on the west side of Kola inlet, opposite Murmansk...Three successive fires, which started in the engine room and spread to the accommodation, gutted the Victory in May.  After the second outbreak, the crew were transferred to another BUT stern trawler, the Kurd, and later the abandoned vessel was taken in tow by a Soviet naval vessel to Murmansk.  

The mate, Phil Carthy, said it was a miracle that any of the crew had survived the inferno.   Things were so bad infact that Norwegian radio put out reports that the trawler had sunk.

Mr McCarthy told waiting reporters: ""It was an absolute inferno.  When we abandoned her the ship was burning from stem to stern and the bridge deck started to melt.   It is a miracle that we are all alive.   The ship could have been blown up.""

The second blaze was thought to have started in the refrigeration room.  The vessel was so hot that water from two Russian gunboats turned into steam as soon as it made contact.   Mr McCarthy said that at one point it was feared that an engineer was trapped in the engine room.

""I was just about to try to go in and get him when I was told he had got out through an escape hatch.  There was nothing we could do about the second fire,"" he said.  There were around 200 tons of fish on board at the time of the fire.'


About three weeks later she rolled over into her present position as a result of leakage in the hull.  Inspection suggested extensive damage which may be irrepairable.  

Victory, built by John Lewis for about £700,000 was Northern Trawlers' first large stern freezer trawler to be based at Grimsby."

Newcastle Courant, 23/11/1860:
Yarmouth - barque GEORGE ARTLE, while biding off winter ton on 16 Nov. was run into by French brig CHARLEMAGNE. GEORGE ARKLE's cable parted and she collided with brig VIOLET, master Rymer, of Hartlepool, carrying away the bowsprit, etc. VIOLET was bound for Dieppe with deals. One of VIOLET's crew named Wardew, dell overboard and was drowned. Remaining four were landed by the sloop WILLIAM of Yarmouth.

Ipswich Journal, 15/6/1861:
Action by owners of brig VIOLET against owners of barque GEORGE ARKLE for damage done in collision in November last in Yarmouth roads, alleged on VIOLET's behalf that GEORGE ARKLE had no light exhibited and no spare anchor forward ready for letting go; that she had her 2 topsails set and her foresail partly set. That she had no head sail sheeted home, that several of the crew were intoxicated and that collision was solely her fault. GEORGE ARKLE's representatives claimed she had been at the mercy of the gale and totally unmanageable from the damage she had received, she was driven across VIOLET's bows; that shortly after the collision she was beached; that she carried a bright light in her rigging; that she was not under sail; that her 2 topsails were only partly sheeted home; that her crew were not intoxicated; that he spare anchor was on main deck forward, but there was not sufficient time to get chain up from below and prepare anchor; that her head gear had been all carried away and therefore it was impossible to set head sails and that collision was not her fault and was result of inevitable accident. Court's unanimous verdict was that sole blame attached to GEORGE ARKLE, that she was bound to have carried lights at the time and that want of these lights contributed to occasion the accident.

Newcastle Courant, 29/11/1861:
Brig VIOLET, of Hartlepool, sold by auction a few days ago as a wreck, has been lifted off the ground. She has since been examined and to the great satisfaction of her purchaser (G.

MacGregor, The Tea Clippers (painting and plan bb.63-.4):
Must have been one of Hall's last ships to be built with the Aberdeen bow (long sharp entrance and long tapering run) before tonnage law changed.  Her builders expected her to be very fast.  Maiden voyage Liverpool-Hong Kong 95 days.  Loading at Whampoa she was the first vessel to arrive home with the new tea that year (1854), taking 103 days to Liverpool.
Owners: James Beazley (32 shares); George Clore, Shipbuilder (16); Joseph Hubbeck (16)
Ship Cost £9,400.
1857 she loaded 5,000 chests tea at Hong Kong and whilst proceeding to Foochow to complete her cargo she took the ground (through the fault of her pilot) on north bank of River Minn near the Mingan Pass on about 10-15 June and the strong tide capsized her.  She later became a total wreck.

Morning Chronicle, 18/02/1854:
The new clipper ship ""VISION"" arrived Liverpool last evening from Aberdeen.

Aberdeen Journal, 11/10/1854:
The new principle of building wooden vessels diagonally instead of the time-honoured plan of ribs and longitudinal  planking with transverse supports has raised controversy as to whether it gave enough strength to make a vessel watertight.  The clipper ship ""VISION"" sailed from Liverpool to China with a very heavy cargo of bale goods and much iron in her bottom.  A report from Mr E. P. C. Rickett, Government Surveyor at Hong Kong, says he boarded the vessel soon after her arrival and has no hesitation in saying he never saw a cargo of the same description turned out in better conidtion - did not observe any sea damage at all.

Daily News, 28/10/1854:
The clipper ship ""VISION"", Capt. A. Douglas, arrived in the Mersey from Hong Kong after a capital run of 103 days.  She sailed from Hong Kong  15 July, Canton 16 July and Anjer [Java] 14 August.  She brings to this country the first cargo of the new teas.  The ""VISION"" has made the run to Hong Kong and back in 7 months and 13 days - fastest passage on record.

Morning Chronicle, 05/01/1855:
Clipper ship ""VISION"" for Singapore touched the ground on the Plunkington Bank, but came off next tide.  She will hve to go into dock and be discharged for examination.

Aberdeen Jouranl, 19/08/1857:
Hong Kong, June 24 - confirms loss of the ship ""VISION"", Gaudy, while under pilot charge at entrance of River Min.  Having discharged bulk of her cargo from England at Hong Kong, she left 20th June for Foochowfoo. Whether there was a want of pilot knowledge, or by an excusable accident, the ""VISION"" took the ground and became a total wreck.  She had taken about 5000 chests of old tea in here, the whole of which is gone, though some treasure on board was promptly salved by parties from the Pagoda Anchorage."

Ipswich Journal, 25/01/1876:
Aldeburgh Petty Sessions - John West, fireman on board the screw steamer VOLANT, was brought up for refusing to continue his voyage from the Alde River to London. Captain William George May said ""I am the Captain of the screw steamer VOLANT and West was fireman aboard the vessel. On Monday 17th I ordered him to work and he refused, he wanted his discharge. I refused to discharge him as he had signed articles for London"". - Alexander, the chief engineer, corroborated the satement of the captain.

'Particulars of the Wreck - Statements of the Survivors. 

The Voyage from England.  The Walter Hood, of 918 tons register, was launched in the year 1852 from the shipbuilding yard of Mr. Hood, of Aberdeen. She formed one of Messers. George Thompson & Sons' line of clippers, and has always borne a good name for making prompt passages; The ship left the Start Point on the 23rd Janunry, having a full cargo and three passengers, viz., Messrs. Smith (2) and Haynes. She made splendid run-to the line, but from thence to the Cape of Good Hope the passage was retarded by a succession of calms and light airs. 
Large numbers ships were every day in sight. In running down the easting, she was favoured with fine weather, and made some capital runs. 

Passed Cape Otway on the morning of Saturday, the 23rd April, with a fine breeze, which led the ship through Bass's Straits, and she logged twelve and thirteen knots. On the afternoon of the 24th a heavy gale took the ship very suddenly, and carried away studsails and studsail booms.

THE GALE - THE SHIP ON A LEE SHORE.

On the morning of the 25th the gale continued and the fore and main topsails were blown away.  The sea broke very high, and a seaman named Wilkie, while in the act of getting a boat-hook out of the boat, was washed overboard and drowned.  Another topsail was set, but it shared no better fate than the first. The ship was then supposed to be off Cape Howe - weather thick; gale continuing.

On Tuesday, 26th, weather still very thick, and incessant rain. No observation could be taken, in consequence. The ship was going by dead reckoning under foretopmast staysail, foresail, and foretopsail. The mainsail and mizzentopsail were both close reefed, mid a maintop-gallantsail was bent for a foresail. About four p.m. the land was sighted, the ship running right on with square yards. The sea was running mountains high.  About five o'clock wore ship, and tried to stand off shore.  This time the foretopsail was blown to pieces, and there was not sufficient canvas left on the ship to work her off the lee shore, which was momentarily becoming closer and closer ; and was evident to all on board that she would go on shore. Our informant states that there was no more canvas on board to put on the ship; and if so, she must have been but poorly found in sails.

THE SHIP STRIKES.

The land sighted was at first thought by some of the crew to be Sydney Heads. Nothing had been seen of the lights either at Gabo Island or at Jervis Bay. At 7.30 p.m. the ship struck the shore, and immediately the rudder unshipped. The port anchor was let go, but there was no chance of paying out cable, as the decks at once filled fore and aft. Some of the crew took to the rigging, others to tho poop.  Captain Latto, while forward, endeavouring to get the cable to pay out, had two of his ribs broken: and an apprentice named Gale was severely hurt, being caught between a floating water-cask and spar. The anchor appeared to hold, for the ship swung round with her head to the gale, but afterwards heeled over on her beam ends on the port side, and remained firmly fixed in that position. Captain Latto was, as soon as possible, got into bed, and the rest of the crew left the rigging and were in the cabin all night excepting the cook, who kept in the ship's rigging.

THE MASTS CUT AWAY.

Wednesday, 27th. - Cut away the main and mizen musts, in the hope that the ship would right herself, but her position was in no way altered. Some most heart-rending scenes took place on this day in the attempts of the crew to reach the shore. Some of the most expert swimmers, with lines, made the attempt, and man after man ventured, but only to be swallowed up in the raging waves. An ordinary seaman named Davis was the first who made the attempt ; he was at once drowned, but his fate did not deter others. Ashdown, A.B next attempted, and was taken out to sea by the surf, and disappeared. No more then ventured until next morning at daylight, when the distance to the shore seemed so small that all expected to be saved.

THE SHIP BEGINS TO BREAK UP - EFFORTS OF THE CREW TO REACH THE SHORE.

The ship, however, began to show signs of breaking up, and the cargo began to wash out. Mr Haynes, passenger, and two seamen then went over the side to try to make the shore, and almost succeeded. After a gallant struggle with the waves however, they were swept out to sea as helpless as the floating cargo that was being tossed in all directions. In the afternoon the boatswain (J Sinclair) attempted to gain the shore on a life-buoy but was driven against the ship's side, and apparently; stunned. At night the foremast washed out of the ship. The sea then appeared to be going down.

On the next (Friday) morning two coloured men reputed good swimmers, tried to got a line to shore but failed. One was drowned ; the other, after I fearful struggle, reached the shore. A youth, a native of Sydney, was thu second to"" reach tho shor olivo. Then followed the first officer (Mr. Howison and the second officer (Mr. Cullen) who both reached land in safety. Two seamen, Lemon and another then made the attempt, but were drowned. An apprentice named Gale also reached shore.

THE WRECK IS DISCOVERED FROM THE SHORE.

In the afternoon of this day (Friday) two strangers were seen on shore, and it is thought that they were attracted to the place by a dog and a pig, which had been washed on shore after the ship struck, and had probablv made their way to the nearest habitation. The ship was gradually washing to pieces, and it was not thought she would hold together for another night.

DEATH OF CAPTAIN LATTO.

Captain Latto, who had been compelled to keep his bed from the injuries received, on Friday afternoon called for help, and was got out on the side of the ship, with very little clothing. He, however, afterwords got into his cabin again, it is thought with the intention of securing some of his papers. When he was next seen he was struggling amongst the broken wreck, and no aid could reach him, and he suffered a fearful death. The carpenter constructed a raft and he and one of the seamen embarked on it for the shore, but the surf swept them back, and they again got on to the wreck. M'Pherson, able seaman, swam on shore; and there being not now so much sea on, another of the passengers, Mr. Smith, made for the shore, followed by his brother, and two seamen named Turner and Croy, and all reachod land in safety. The third mate, Tickler, an apprentice named Sinclair, and a coloured man also made for the land, but had to return to the ship. The cook (this day) died from exhaustion.

ATTEMPTS OF THOSE ON SHORE TO SAVE THE SURVIVORS.

On the afternoon of this day (Friday), two strangers attempted to swim off from the shore, one having a rope; but it having parted on the first attempt, he went off a second time, and, getting as near the wreck as he could, told them to cheer up, and hold out till morning, when succour would reach them.

SUFFERINGS OF THE CREW - THEY KILL  A  DOG TO SUSTAIN LIFE.

Tho thirteen remaining souls on the wreck had been without food since Tuesday afternoon, and all were now in a dreadfully exhausted state. As a last resource of sustaining life, a small dog was killed, and his blood and part of his flesh used for food. In the afternoon a large number of people were observed on shore. The crew passed a miserable night on the wreck and wore becoming quite helpless from exposure, want of rest and food, and consequent exhaustion.

THE RESCUE OF THE SURVIVORS.

On Saturday morning the approach of the Illalong steamer, inspired the survivors with hopes, and dispelled the fear of death that had wellnigh closed round. At seven a.m. the lifeboat of the Illalong was got to the stern of the ship, that being the only portion of wreck remaining, and to which the survivors were clinging. The thirteen souls were soon assisted into the boat, being in a condition in which nature scarcely gave them strength to move. They were carefully and kindly treated on board, and every attention paid to their wants.

When the Illalong left the wreck there was only the after-quarter of the ship holding togother, and the beach was covered with wreck and cargo.

The following are the names of those rescued by the Illalong:-W. Tickler, third mate; David Gray, carpenter ; James Thom, sailmaker; W. L. Sinclair, apprentice ; Barry, steward ; and Butchard, Scott, Fenwick, Moll, Lindsay, Dunkerdon, und two coloured men, seamen.

[The above uccount waa taken down from statements made by the survivors to our reporter; and, very possibly, in some of the details there may be inaccuracies. On the arrival of the chief officer in Sydney we shall doubtless obtain a clue to much that is at present doubtful - we may indeed say inexplicable - relative to the circumstances that led to the loss of the vessel.]



""WRECK OF THE WALTER HOOD.
To the Editor of the Empire, Saturday 7th May 1870:

SIR,- The courageous attempts made by two young gentlemen -viz., Mr. William Harrison and Mr. S. Bailey -to reach the unfortunate people left on the wreck of the Walter Hood, has been warmly appreciated by those who have read the thrilling account of that dreadful catastrophe. Happening to be present today in a place where the heroic conduct of these young men was discussed, it was there and then decided that a statement of the matter should be drawn up and forwarded by next mail to the Royal Humane Society, in order to obtain for Messrs. Harrison and Bailey the society's medal. Pending the arrival of that medal, it was thought expedient to raise a sufficient amount to purchase here, and present at once to these young gentlemen, a substantial token of our admiration. I have been requested to act as secretary and treasurer, duties which I feel most happy to fulfil. In the latter capacity I have already received £4 4s., and I have no doubt that the publication of this letter will suflice to increase the amount to a very appropriate figure.
- JULES JOUBEET.'



The Sydney Morning Herald, Saturday 12th March 1927:
WALTER HOOD      
A WRECK OF THE SEVENTIES.
MEMORIAL CAIRN.

A cairn of stones marks now the graves of the eleven persons drowned in the famous wreck of the Walter Hood, near Red Head, between Ulladulla and Jervis Ray, 57 years ago. The memorial was unveiled on Wednesday by Mr. It. H. Cambage, president of the Australian National Research Council, and two men, young fellows then, but now in their 80th year, who watched the disaster, were present. These, Mr. John Harrison.- who swam from the shore and brought a line half- way back before it broke, and Mr. R. Williams, the first sailor of the foundering ship to swim ashore, recounted to the large assembly which attended the ceremony of unveiling a story that is one of the epics of Australian shipping. Mr. Charles Murray, president of the Clyde Shire also spoke.

The Walter Hood, of more than 900 tons register, was on her way from London to Sydney when she was wrecked. The eleven persons who lost their lives included Captain Latto and one passenger. Ten persons saved themselves by swimming ashore, and 13 were rescued on April 30, four days after the ship commenced to break up, by the steamer Illalong. The cairn of stones, which bears a marble tablet, Inscribed with the names of those buried there, replaces a memorial of wooden slabs reduced by time and bush fires.   Thc cairn stands 14 feet square and 10 feet high, and was erected by the residents of Red Head and Conjola.

Date of Build/Launch: April 1874

This vessel was owned by the Waratah Coal Company between 1874-1887, and registered in the Port of Sydney 48/1874.

On June 7, 1887, the WARATAH ran aground at Bulli, New South Wales and became a total wreck.

LOSS OF THE STEAM COLLIER ""WARATAH”.

[BY SPECIAL WIRE. FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.)
SYDNEY, WEDNESDAY.

The steam collier “Waratah”, which was stranded on the beach at Bulli yesterday, is now embedded hard and fast in sand, and all hope of getting her off is abandoned. The tug sent from Sydney could not get near the stranded vessel on account of the heavy swell, and it is expected that the “Waratah” will soon break up. There is 5ft. of water in the engine room, and the rudder and the stern post are gone. All the movable goods and fittings in the vessel have been landed by means of slings and baskets. The vessel belongs to the Waratah Coal Company, and is fully insured in the Australian General Company, but about 400 tons of coal on board is not covered.

The net register of the vessel is 268 tons, and her gross measurement 425 tons. She was built at Aberdeen in 1874, and was regarded as one of the smartest colliers on the coast.
(Ref.:- The Argus Thursday, June 8th.1887)  

The bell from this vessel is in the possession of Bunbury Historical Society, Western Australia (April 2005).

Daily Telegraph (Sydney), 1/8/1887:
Representative of the Underwriters Association inspected wreck of steamer WARATAH at North Bulli to see whether machinery could be saved. He came to the conclusion it could and operations are to be begun at once. Steamer is still lying in same position as when she first went ashore and excepting that her bulwarks have been carried away to some extent, very little damage appears to have been done, her hull being apparently no more injured than when she was first stranded."

Later Mr Mackenzie came again with additional hands and said (too late) that it would not be necessary to bring the vessel in. Mr Calder refused payment of £1 to Mr Smith on grounds he had disobeyed orders. Capt.

Aberdeen Journal, 07/05/1856:
Launched from yard of Messrs Walter Hood & Co. Yesterday another of those splendid clipper ships, for which this port has become so famous. WAVE OF LIFE, Capt. Stuart (late of Wooloomalloo) has been built expressly for the Australian trade, fitted out in most superior style for passengers, combining all the recent improvements.

Maitland Mercury, 04/12/1856:
Sydney News - ship WAVE OF LIFE, from which a rapid voyage was expected, is now out 109 days from London and nothing has been heard of her - has given rise to some anxiety.

Sydney Empire, 15/12/1856:
One would be inclined to believe that this noble vessel, from the time which has been expended over her voyage from London to Sydney, is not entitled to the name of clipper. Sparred on principle of comparatively short masts and square yards, she has every facility with a moderate share of fair winds and fine weather, but on this her maiden voyage has had succession of reverses. In English channel in terrific squall her fore topmast, fore and main top gallant masts went by the board, which compelled Capt. Stuart to put into Plymouth - she experienced foul winds and calms nearly all the way to the line. Successive light winds and calms until she reached meridian of Cape of Good Hope on 74th day out. From there to Cape Otway she showed her capabilities, repeatedly running 10 knots an hour. Reached Sydney yesterday, having left London 16th August.

Royal Cornwall Gazette, 25 December:
The WELCOME was one of the vessels stranded at Plymouth by the great gale of 21/22 November 1824 - The 142 ton brig WELCOME, Morris, from the Canary Islands (Times of 27 November) of Aberdeen, was cast ashore at Wembury, together with the brig JOHN, of Bideford, Thomas Wills, master, from Leghorn to London. ""The lookout man on the station at Yealm at day-break discovered the two vessels onshore, the JOHN at this time was almost a perfect wreck, her masts were gone, and a female was perceived clinging to the side of the vessel; but none of the crew were in view. The sea was... breaking over the vessel with great violence... James Crags, boatman, of the station at Yealm, being an expert swimmer, watched his opportunity, and on the waves receding, fearless of danger, rushed in, and succeeded in reaching the vessel and rescuing the unfortunate woman, who was the only living creature on board, from her perilous situation... The tide in the meantime having receded, the wreck was surrounded by numbers of the country people, drawn down to the spot with a view to plunder and some of them had gained access to the cabin, and secured and borne off several articles, when they were interrupted in their infamous pursuit by the arrival of Lieutenant J. R. Godfrey and his party from the Yealm station"".
The crew of the WELCOME were all saved but the captain's wife was the only survivor from the JOHN. Both the JOHN and the WELCOME survived the winter on the exposed beach, to be advertised for sale by auction on 3 March.
On 22 March, both were sold, the WELCOME was reported purchased by Mr. Cumming for £1,100 but the JOHN, (sold to Mr. Wake shipbuilder of London) only reached £200. Refloated during the week of 21 April both vessels were immediately brought into Plymouth for repair.

Lloyds List 7351, 25 September 1837:
""Thistead 15 September - The WELCOME, Russell from St. Petersburg for Plymouth was stranded on this coast yesterday. She is full of water and it is feared will be wrecked. Crew and part of the cargo saved"".

Aberdeen Press & Journal, 1st May 1954:
'The British Transport Commission have decided to set up a small development team to review the trends of traffic in their various short sea trades and, taking into account the possible advances in naval architecture and marine engineering, to assess the type of ships which will be needed in ten years' time.
This statement was made by Mr H. A. Short, chief regional manager, British Railways, North Eastern Region, at a luncheon which followed the launch yesterday of the motor vessel Whitby Abbey from the yard of Hall, Russell & Co. Ltd.
Mr Short, who was replying to a toast to the owners, Associated Humber Lines, Hull,  which was given by Sir Alfred Ayres, said they had faith in the future of surface transport by land and sea, and believed it still had a sound part to play in international commerce and international passenger movement.
The launch of the Whitby Abbey was evidence of that faith.
Other speakers included Mr J. L. Harrington, chief officer (marine), British Rilways, British Transport Commission; Mr H. W. R. Ogram, general manager Associated Humber Lines, and Mr Colin S. McLay, director and general manager, Hall, Russell & Co. Ltd.
The Whitby Abbey, a single screw, open-shelter-deck vessel of 256ft. in overall length, was named by Mrs H. W. R. Ogram.  The vessel will link Hull and Goole with Rotterdam, Antwerp, Ghent, Hamburg, Bremen and Dunkirk.  She brings the Associated Humber Lines Fleet to fourteen.  A sister ship, the Fountains Abbey, is expected to be launched in a few weeks' time, also from the yard of Hall, Russell  Co. Ltd.
Particular attention has been given to the construction of the Whitby Abbey to facilities for carrying fruit and vegetables from the Continent.  Thermotank mechanical ventilation has been installed.'"

Evening Express, Tuesday 20 November 1956:
'Washed Overboard from Trawler
The Aberdeen trawler Dorileen reported this afternoon that she was searching for a member of her crew who had been washed overboard in heavy seas.
Peterhead lifeboat was launched and a plane assisted in the search covering an area between four miles north-east of Aberdeen and Buchan Ness.
The Dorileen, which left Aberdeen for the fishing grounds this forenoon, is in radio-telephone touch with her owners, Messrs Richard Irvin and Sons, Albert Quay'.

Evening Express, Wednesday 21 November 1956:
'Missing From Trawler Then -
""LOST AT SEA"" MAN TURNS UP
This is the fantastic story of an Aberdeen trawlerman who walked into his home last night a few hours after having been reported as missing at sea.
Mr John Craig (43), 10 Black's Buildings, left for the Faroes yesterday morning on board the trawler Dorileen.  About 2p.m., as he was walking aft from the wheelhouse, a huge wave swept over the ship. Minutes later he was found to be missing. The vessel was then about four miles off Buchan Ness.
Skipper John Watson, Dundee, turned out all hands and searched the trawler. He also called Peterhead lifeboat and asked ships in the vicinity to help him search the sea. Three planes - a Neptune from Kinloss, an Anson from Turnhouse, and a B.E.A. Pionair returning from Orkney - joined the hunt.
SEARCH TILL DARK
The search continued until dark, when the Dorileen returned to Aberdeen to report that Mr Craig had not been found.
Police boarded the vessel and took statements from the crew. Reporters interviewed the skipper.
Mr James Grimshaw, superintendent of the Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen, Aberdeen, immediately went to Mr Craig's home to break the news.
Mrs Craig, mother of five young children and expecting another, was stunned. Mr Grimshaw comforted her and gathered the family round in prayer.
Later in the evening, Mr Grimshaw returned to offer the family further assistance.
But, to his astonishment, he found the ""missing"" man sitting by the fireside.
Mr Craig seemed dazed and unwell but was able to tell Mr Grimshaw what he believed to have happened.
AMAZING STORY
Shortly afterwards, sitting up in bed awaiting a medical examination, Mr Craig told an ""Evening Express"" reporter his amazing story.
""I had been speaking to the skipper on the bridge, when we were an hour or two out of Aberdeen. Just after I left the bridge, we were hit by a dollop of water on the starboard side.
""I was swept overboard and remember saying to myself, 'This is cheerio'. I was on my back in the water and managed to get rid of my boots.
""The I was washed back on to the trawler.  How, I just don't know. It must have been the angle the ship was lying at. I got jammed right aft beneath the casing supporting the small boat and beside the rudder chain. My arm and side seemed to be stuck.
""I must have passed out, for the next thing I remember was coming to and finding the trawler tied up in port and apparently deserted. I got a lift home in a lorry"".
MISSIONARY'S VISIT
Mrs Craig, sitting by her husband's bedside, told of the visit she had received earlier from Mr Grimshaw.
""He asked if my husband had sailed in the morning and then said he had news for me. I couldn't believe the news. He was most kind and helpful. Mrs Robertson, a neighbour, called. She and her husband took me and the children to her house.
""I was sitting there when another neighbour rushed in to say that my husband was back. It was wonderful"".
Mr Craig, who has worked on trawlers about sixteen years, was making his first trip on the Dorileen. His elder brother, Donald, was lost off a trawler some years ago.
DOCTOR'S VERDICT
Mr Craig wanted to go to sea to-day with Dorileen, but his doctor's verdict was that he should stay in bed as he was suffering from shock and exposure.
An official of Richard Irvin and Sons, Ltd., owners of the trawler, said: ""He wanted to go on board, but we thought he had better not"".

WHAT’S IN A NAME? The three BEN ARDNAs.
Does anyone know if there is a hill called Ben Ardna?

The first BEN ARDNA was a steam trawler, launched by Hall, Russell & Co. Ltd. at Aberdeen on the 9th December 1912. She was built at a cost of £5,950 for one of Aberdeen’s leading trawlowning firms, Richard Irvin and Sons Ltd. of Albert Quay, and was registered in Aberdeen with the number A 517 on Boxing Day 1912.
She did not have a long career in fishing, as in August 1914, along with another twenty-seven of Richard Irvin’s fleet, she was requisitioned by the Admiralty and put to work as a minesweeper with the Dover Patrol.
As with her fishing career, her naval career was also short lived. On the 8th August 1915, off the Elbow Buoy at the mouth of the River Tay, she suffered the fate of many other trawlers engaged in minesweeping, and detonated a mine which had been laid by the German submarine UC.1.
She sank with the loss of two of her Royal Naval Reserve crew: -
William Harwood Brown, a Second Hand aged 35, the son of Mrs Mary Duck of Scarborough.
and 
Henry Herbert Morris, a Deckhand and husband of Mrs Helen Taylor of Aberdeen.

The second and third BEN ARDNAs were both wartime “Strath” class trawlers. 
These standard trawlers were built in large numbers during WWI throughout the U.K. and by various shipyards, but all were based on a standard design for both the hull and machinery produced by Hall, Russell, who took the lead in their production.  At the end of the war, the Admiralty had no use for these large numbers of basic minesweepers and in the early 1920s they were sold off for commercial use as either trawlers or small cargo vessels.

In 1920, Richard Irvin bought two of these vessels to replace the company’s war losses, the WILLIAM BARLOW and the JOHN BRADFORD. These were exact sister ships, built by Hall, Russell and launched on the same day, the 15th July 1917, as Yard Nos 606 and 607. 
The Strath Class were all named after members of the crew of either H.M.S. Victory or Royal Sovereign at the Battle of Trafalgar, and both William Barlow and John Bradford were Privates in the Marines on H.M.S. Victory.

The William Barlow was first registered by the Admiralty at London, with the Official Number 144416, but when she was bought by Richard Irvin, they registered her in Aberdeen under the ownership of R. Irvin & Sons Ltd, North Shields. The Lloyds Register Supplement entry (78525) for 1920 lists her as being named the DORILEEN, ex BEN ARDNA, ex WILLIAM BARLOW. This vessel remained in the Irvin fleet until she was broken up in 1957.

The John Bradford was also registered by the Admiralty at London, with the Official Number 144415, and bought by Richard Irvin. Her entry in the Lloyds Register Supplement for 1920 (77709) records her being named BEN ARDNA, ex DORILEEN, ex JOHN BRADFORD. She to was registered at Aberdeen, with the fishing number A412 and remained in Irvin’s fleet until requisitioned as an examination vessel in WWII. She sank in 1942 after a collision on the Tyne, fortunately without loss of life.

Thus, both vessels were, according to Lloyds, named BEN ARDNA, but they changed names. Why, in the case of the DORILEEN, Irvin departed from their usual practice of naming all their ships with the prefix BEN, or who, what or where the name Dorileen came from, is not recorded and remains a mystery.

Wrecked 2 March 1928. On North Head, Peterhead. 
""A 'Strath' class trawler built for the Admiralty in 1917, the WILLIAM BUTLER was one of some 500 trawlers built to replace war loss ships and to maintain the nation's fishing industry...
She was returning from a week long fishing trip on the Scourie Bank, off the West Coast of Scotland, with haddock and cod, when she ran aground in fog on the North Head, close to Peterhead Harbour entrance. The local life-saving rocket brigade attended the wreck, setting up the apparatus on the deck of a derelict crane barge which had been wrecked some years earlier. From here they successfully fired a line over the trawler, a breeches buoy was rigged and all the survivors were brought safely ashore"".

In May of last year the WILLIAM DUTHIE brought to this colony from London one bale of white blankets and one bale of serge and green baize.  Plaintiffs claim that because of improper stowage the bales were chaffed by the iron hoops of barrels and damaged by acid seepage.  Defence was that goods were properly stowed and only damage they suffered was through salt water, for which defendent was not liable under his contract.  Ship had experienced very bad weather and a good deal of water was shipped.  Case continued.

Illustrated Sydney News, 16/02/1867:
On her last voyage home from this port WILLIAM DUTHIE had to force her way through icebergs (which have proved fatal to so many gallant vessels). For nearly a week the most incessant watchfulness was displayed by the Captain and officers, who hardly ever left the deck. It was feared ice would cut through her bow and to counteract this an ingenious shield was formed of ropes, spars and canvas, which proved most effectual, one monster serg came into contact with the ship's quarter and crushed one of her timbers, but but she stood it nobly and at length when all hands were almost exhausted with working and watching, clear water was announced.

Sloop industry arrived Belfast from St. Bartholomew, brought over 4 seaman who belonged to brig WILLIAMINA, Smith, of Greenock, which was run on board 22 June by barque WEN VOLUNTEER, a fishing boat, passing the 5 Islands, seeing men on shore making distress signals, ran in and took them (9 in number) to St. Barts. WILLIAMINA was on voyage Trinidad-Greenock when 100 miles off St. Barts she spoke and was then run into by WEN VOLUNTEER and stove in her quarter. 7 of crew got on board the barque when the vessels parted. The captain of WILLIAMINA sent the 2nd mate and one of the remaining men in the long boat to bring back his 7 men, the barque being then 1/2 mile to Leeward. They got to the barque and took in the 7 men. During the night they saw the light of the brig, but were unable to pull against the wind and tide and at daybreak could see neither vessel. They drifted for several days before landing on the 5 Islands. There remained on WILLIAMINA only the captain, the mate and the steward. It is supposed she bore away to some port to Leeward."

WILMINGTON was built for Stephenson Clarke Shipping by Hall Russell.  The ship was named by Lady Ogilvie, wife of Sir Alec Ogilvie, deputy Chairman of Powell Duffryn (Stephenson Clarke was subsidiary of PD).  Ship was named after a Sussex village and designed to carry all types of bulk cargo.  To trade on Baltic and Continental seaboard.  To carry crew of 24.

WILMINGTON was a 3 hatch hold with no cranes or derricks, with the crew's quarters and bridge at the aft end of the ship.

Hall Russell also built the SHOREHAM (1834GRT) in 1957 and the FERRING & MALLING (2835GRT) in 1969-70 for the same company.  The companies ships are easily spotted by a white band that goes around the ship on the bulwark tops and black funnel with a silver band.

WILMINGTON's main cargo was coal from the Tyne, Immingham and Newport to the electricity coal fired stations.  WILMINGTON occasionally traded to the Med with grain from Ipswich to Ravenna and short trips to Venice to load maize for Hamburg.

WILMINGTON was scrapped as coal powered electric stations stopped operating: Laid up in the Tyne and then scrapped in Bruges in 1986 (Zeebrugge 17 May 1986)."

Aberdeen Journal, 27/12/1871:
Intelligence received at Portsmouth of very serious casualty about 20 miles off St. Catherine's, Isle of Wight, between 11 and 12 o'clock Friday night, which resulted in foundering of a French ship and loss of 17 lives after collision with a ship, name unknown. It appears it was Aberdeen ship WINDSOR CASTLE in collision with French ship COSTA RICA and left her in disabled state without rendering any assistance. We print reports from Master, Mate and passengers of WINDSOR CASTLE in which allegation of carelessness on her part is very emphatically denied.

Glasgow Herald, 23/12/1871:
Extract from letter to owners of WINDSOR CASTLE from its Master, Capt. Cargill, from Dartmouth, where he had put in for repairs:- ""I was on deck at the time and saw a vessel on the port tack... finding he was coming right for us hailed him repeatedly, but he paid no attention and immediately struck us abreast main hatch, carrying away 30ft. of main rail, tearing sails and carrying away portion of rigging... after getting wreck and braces clear... I tacked and tried to find the vessel but could see nothing of her"".

Hampshire Telegraph, 23/12/1871:
Letter from J. Alexander Bell and George Leslie, passengers on WINDSOR CASTLE. ""The story by some of survivors of COSTA RICA and by Capt. Rook is almost in every detail utterly untrue.  We were on deck throughout. So far as we understand the rule of the road, Capt. Cargill neglected no precaution to avert the collision.  The French vessel bore steadily down upon us and although hailed in time made no sign of any kind but ran into us amid ships. There was no one seen on the deck of the COSTA RICA. It took some little time to get the WINDSOR CASTLE under command again. But then the Captain stood round to look for the other and stayed about the place for some considerable time. It was not possible to get out our boats as they were on the skids and our men were so fully occupied with the work wrought by the COSTA RICA on their own ship.

Manchester Times, 13/01/1872:
Burning down of ship COSTA RICA - Board of Trade enquiry into collision in English Channel 15 December: Court have not slightest hesitation in acquitting Master of WINDSOR CASTLE of all blame in collision with the COSTA RICA.  WINDSOR CASTLE being on starboard tack and COSTA RICA on port tack, it became well-known duty of COSTA RICA to keep clear of her. Admitted by her crew she saw red light of WINDSOR CASTLE in sufficient time. Court quite satisfied there was no wilful lack of rendering assistance to COSTA RICA and that any failure to do so may, under special circumstances of difficulty, be reasonably excused. Court makes no observation as to mode in which boats were kept on WINDSOR CASTLE as they consider this subject not within province of present enquiry.

WINDSOR CASTLE, of Aberdeen, McDonald master. Arrived at Sundawall [Sweden] 1 October.

Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 11/11/1887
Ship WINDSOR CASTLE arrived Aberdeen last night from Sandswall with cargo of timber. While being towed into Victoria dock, she struck the point of the drawbridge at south side of entrance. Rebounding, she came into violent contact with the railing, which was broken in 3 places, because of delay tide had gone out and she had insufficient water to berth at Provost Blackie's Quay and grounded about a dozen yards from quay. She has encountered a succession of gales after leaving Sandswall 22 October. At south end of Gotland she had to heave to on account of water she was making on 2 November. She had to be towed into Malmo Roads, heavy E N E gales across North Sea and on several occasions she was hove to. On Outward voyage she was twice in collision, but escaped almost without injury. She carries crew of 17.

(Ref: Time Line Navy & Ship Events (1946-2000)

Note: Comben Longstaff & Co. Ltd. had a number of vessels built by John Lewis all 
ending with the name ""---------BROOK"".


""09/03/2009 The GLAMORGANBROOK was on its first voyage after an 18 week overhaul in dry dock. She was bound for the Isle of Wight out of Blythe with a cargo of coal. At 2.40 a.m. she was off Robin Hood's Bay when she developed a slight list to port and then sprang a leak in the No2 hold. The pumps could not cope with the increasing inrush of water and the master ordered the crew to abandon ship. The crew of 14 and the Captain's wife successfully transferred to the boat but Captain Barker, who was the last to leave, perished after giving up his life jacket to his wife and falling between the boat and the ship.

He was unable to swim. The ship sank in five minutes ""turning turtle"" before going down. The survivors proceeded to row, in heavy seas, towards Scarborough. Meanwhile the Scarborough and Whitby Lifeboats were launched in response to the vessels S.O.S. call. Both boats were unable to locate any sign of the ship or crew off Robin Hood's Bay and it was not until the Scarborough boat returned home that the survivors were spotted, by this time only 1½ miles from the Castle Head. This ended the colourful service of a vessel that was torpedoed and sunk during the Dunkirk evacuations, salvaged by the Germans, recaptured by the British in 1945 at Flensburg.

After the war she was sold to the merchant service as a prize of war, along with many other captured vessels"".

""09/03/2009 Times 12/10/1946:- SHIP'S MASTER DROWNED - Eric Barker, master of the 350-ton steamer GLAMORGANBROOK, was drowned when the ship sank off the Yorkshire Coast early yesterday. He was a non-swimmer and was lost while struggling to reach the ship's boat containing his wife and 13 members of the crew. When on her way from Blyth, Northumberland to Cowes, with a cargo of coal, the ship sprang a leak and began to fill rapidly. She was abandoned two hours later. The survivors were landed at Scarborough. The GLAMORGANBROOK left dry dock only a week ago after 18 weeks' overhaul. She was sunk at Dunkirk, but salvaged by the Germans and used by them until her recapture in 1945 at Flensburg"".
